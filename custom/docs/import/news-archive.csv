<p>Registration is now open for the 2015 Sleep and Breathing Conference, the largest pan-European meeting in the field of sleep medicine.</p>
<p>The importance of sleep for health has received growing attention in recent years and has become a key area of research in medicine. There is now a realisation that sleep disorders, whether respiratory or non-respiratory, contribute substantially to the burden of ill health across society.</p>
<p>The Sleep and Breathing conference is the only meeting offering an integrated approach to the investigation and treatment of sleep disorders.</p>
<p>Joint Chair of the Sleep and Breathing Conference Professor Walter McNicholas said: “The conference will provide a state-of-the-art review of the latest developments in sleep and breathing disorders and thus provide a comprehensive update that will benefit all practitioners in the area of sleep medicine.”</p>
<p>Anita Simonds, Joint Chair of the Sleep and Breathing Conference, added: “Unmissable highlights include a Year in Review in sleep research, and sessions on dilemmas in the daily management of OSA patients, the effects of sleep on cognitive function and memory, sleep disordered breathing in cardiac patients, the consequences of sleep deprivation, chronobiology, screening for sleep apnoea, non-invasive ventilation, training in sleep medicine and many more!”</p>
<p>In Barcelona 2015, the focus remains predominantly on sleep and breathing disorders and the programme will also cover sleep-related areas of paediatrics, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, psychology, psychiatry and neurology.</p>

4975;Smoking linked with 14 extra health conditions;smoking-linked-with-14-extra-health-conditions;"<p>14 health conditions have been newly linked with smoking, according to an observational study published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>The findings of the study suggested that smoking could be responsible for many more deaths than previously thought. Researchers used data from 5 cohort studies in the USA including 421,378 men and 532,651 women 55 years of age or older. Participants were followed from 2000 through 2011, and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated.</p>
<p>The results showed that an additional 60,000 deaths appear to be caused by diseases not typically associated with tobacco, including kidney failure, intestinal disease, heart disease caused by hypertension, infections, breathing problems, and breast and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Chair of the ERS Tobacco Control Committee, Professor Carlos Jimenez-Ruiz: “This study provides some observational findings, increasing the evidence of a correlation between smoking and a number of health conditions that have not previously been completely linked to the habit. If further research confirmed this link, we have even more evidence demonstrating why our commitment to tobacco control and a local, national and international level is essential.”</p>

4978;Celebrating 10 years of the landmark tobacco control treaty;celebrating-10-years-of-the-landmark-tobacco-control-treaty;"<p>The 10th anniversary of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) will be marked by healthcare professionals and tobacco control advocates worldwide tomorrow (27 February 2015).</p>
<p>179 countries, plus the European Union, are signed up to the treaty and WHO is calling on them all to recommit to its aims and adopt effective tobacco control policies.</p>
<p>The treaty has accelerated change in all countries, but only a few in the WHO’s European Region have taken a comprehensive approach to implementing all the actions recommended by the FCTC.</p>
<p>The European Region has the highest prevalence of tobacco smoking (28%) among all WHO regions. It has now taken on the challenge of developing a Roadmap of actions for Member States to reduce tobacco use by 30% by the year 2025.</p>
<p>ERS is committed to tobacco control and recently produced the SmokeHaz website (<a href=""http://www.smokehaz.eu"">www.smokehaz.eu</a>) – providing evidence from a scientific review of all the respiratory health hazards associated with tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>ERS is an active supporter of the Conference of the Parties (COP6) of the WHO FCTC. At the last meeting in Moscow in October 2014, representatives from the ERS Tobacco Control Committee (TCC) attended and ERS also supported delegates from low- and middle-income countries to attend the meetings, via the Framework Convention Alliance. Delegates from Bangladesh, the Philippines, India, Brazil, Syria and Thailand were supported in this way.</p>
<p>Constantine Vardavas, the ERS TCC representative reported: “It is vital that ERS is present and participates in the COP, as it is the spearhead of global tobacco control. Being part of these negotiations allows ERS to take an active role in tobacco control and spread the latest scientific evidence in the field. This year, in sponsoring delegates from low and middle income countries, we have gone a step further in our commitment to supporting tobacco control at a global level.”</p>

4979;First global consultation on the role of e/mHealth in TB and tobacco control ;first-global-consultation-on-the-role-of-emhealth-in-tb-and-tobacco-control-;"<p>Over 90 representatives from governments, technical agencies, financing partners, the corporate sector as well as civil society, are meeting in Geneva for a first-ever consultation on the role of electronic and mobile health (e/mHealth) interventions in TB and tobacco control. This consultation has been organised by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global TB Programme and Department for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases with the European Respiratory Society (ERS).</p>
<p>Both TB and tobacco are major global public health concerns, causing millions of deaths each year. There is a strong association between smoking and TB, with each fuelling the other's impact. Information and communication technology could provide new solutions and avenues for joint action on both of these diseases.</p>
<p>""The consultation will lead the way in defining how we can harness the power of information and communication technologies to end TB,"" said Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of the WHO Global TB Programme. ""In particular, the use of these technologies will be critical in helping us reach our new global targets to end the TB epidemic.""</p>
<p>""While some countries and partners have already initiated small pilot initiatives on e/mHealth, these haven't been taken to scale due to a lack of sufficient evidence, support and synergic action. The full potential of information and communication technology thus remains largely untapped and presents a significant opportunity in the fight against TB and tobacco use,"" said Dr Doug Bettcher, Director of the WHO Department for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases.</p>
<h3>Moving forward</h3>
<p>The consultation will feed into the development of different information and communication technology concepts and products that address patient care, surveillance and monitoring, as well as programme management (particularly laboratory information systems), and eLearning.</p>
<p>""We see this meeting as uniting experts who will play different roles in shaping the future of e/mHealth for TB and tobacco control,"" said Elisabeth Bel, President of ERS. ""We remain committed to supporting this ground-breaking effort to revolutionise the use of information and communication technologies to save lives.""</p>
<p>Professor GB Migliori, Secretary General of ERS, said: “E/mHealth products represent a prime opportunity for us to revolutionise healthcare and tackle two of the world’s biggest public health problems. This technical consultation is paving the way for digital technologies to play a key role in the management of patients with TB and tobacco-related illnesses. While new products and programmes are emerging all the time, it is crucial that we assess the effectiveness of these measures and channel our resources accordingly.”</p>";50;26.02.2015 10:41

<p><span>I feel honoured to be the first female President of ERS and I am pleased to be taking up the mantle in the knowledge that many successful women have come before me and many more will follow in these footsteps in years to come. </span></p>
<p><span>I strongly subscribe to the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day that ‘Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture it!’ In a speech last year the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon highlighted the benefits to society as a whole when women are on a level footing. One example he cited is that countries in which higher levels of gender equality exist tend to have better economic g</span>rowth.<a href=""#one""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span>Historically, the scientific field has been largely dominated by men, but this has begun to change. As we see a more equal gender balance in science, I believe we will see more progress in the field of scientific discovery. By unlocking the scientific potential of many individuals who may not have considered this area of work in previous years, we bring more intellectual minds together to solve the toughest questions in research.</span></p>
<p><span>I also believe that by ensuring women are at the forefront of medicine and care, we can bring different life experiences and perspectives together to ensure a diverse workforce is challenging the clinical issues we face on a daily basis. We must continue to encourage women to take on roles in the respiratory field if we are to see the progress we are all working towards. </span></p>
<p><span>In the respiratory arena, many influential women have taken on the roles of officers in ERS and other international societies, contributed extensively to research and become leaders in their field. </span></p>
<p><span>At the ERS International Congress in Munich last year, we launched the Fellowship of ERS (FERS), a new accolade that seeks to recognise excellence in the field and to create a body of elite r</span>esearchers, clinicians and other professionals working in the respiratory arena. 11 women were honoured with the FERS title when the new award launched, and this number is set to increase in the coming years.<a href=""#two""><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the women who have played a role in the success of the Society over the last few years. I also send a message of encouragement to all our female junior members who, together with their male peers, have the future of the Society in their hands. I have no doubt that the combined strengths of both the female and male future leaders of ERS will lead to progress for all. </span><span><br style=""clear: both;"" /></span></p>

<p>The research, published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, measured lung function annually in 2,120 children in southern California, where air quality control policies have been gradually implemented over the past few years.</p>
<p>The researchers used linear regression models to examine the relationship between decreasing pollution levels and lung-function development between the ages of 11 and 15 using spirometry.</p>
<p>Significant clinical improvements in lung function development were observed in both boys and girls in children with and without asthma. As the air quality improved, the percentage of 15 year olds with clinically low lung function declined from 7.9% to 3.6%.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that causality could be assumed from these results and the positive effects seen to human health support measures that reduce air pollution.</p>

4991;Antibiotic nanoparticles attack respiratory infection at source and reduce drug side effects;antibiotic-nanoparticles-attack-respiratory-infection-at-source-and-reduce-drug-side-effects;"<p>&nbsp;<strong style=""font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;"">Estoril, Portugal:</strong><span style=""font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;""> Treating respiratory disease is often difficult because drugs have to cross biological barriers such as respiratory tissue and mucosa, and must therefore be given in large quantities in order for an effective amount to reach the target. Now researchers from Germany, Brazil and France have shown that the use of nanoparticles to carry antibiotics across biological barriers can be effective in treating lung infections. Doing so allows better delivery of the drug to the site of infection, and hence prevents the development of antibiotic resistance which may be caused by too large and continued doses of antibiotic. Additionally, such a strategy might help to overcome the rapid metabolism and excretion of the antibiotic from the body, which happens when it is administered by traditional routes,either orally or intravenously.</span></p>
<p>Describing her team’s work to the 13th European Respiratory Society Lung Science Conference in Estoril today (Friday), Dr Cristiane Carvalho-Wodarz, from the Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research, Saarbrücken, Germany, will say that, by developing nanoparticles loaded with clarithromycin, an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of respiratory infections, they have been able to mimick the process that occurs after inhalation in vivo by delivering the drug through aerosol deposition to lung cells. Nanoparticles, which are in the same size range as a virus - millions of times smaller than a tennis ball - were prepared by adding a biodegradable polymer oil, stabiliser and clarithromycin dissolved in solvents, to an aqueous surfactant solution. Subsequently, the solvents were completely removed. “The delivery of nanoparticles in this way enables their deposition in cells cultivated in vitro in a similar way to the deposition in vivo, which take place in the alveoli (air sacs found in the respiratory tract),” Dr Carvalho-Wodarz will say.</p>
<p>The researchers used the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus as the model for their experiment, since it is one of the major causes of hospital-acquired infection and also plays a crucial role in the lung infections which are common in the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. The tiny clarithromycin nanoparticles (CLARI-NPs), were able to access the bacteria located either in biofilms (cellssticking to each other on a surface) or inside individual lung cells. “Neither of these locations is conducive to effective drug delivery through traditional routes,” says Dr Carvalho-Wodarz, “so we were pleased to see that not only did the use of CLARI-NPs allow the uptake of the antibiotic by the lung cells, but also that there were no toxic effects on all the cell types on which we tested.”</p>
<p>To date the work has been in vitro, using human bronchial cells. The researchers now hope to evaluate its effectiveness in an animal model, probably mice. They would also like to test the same nanoparticles loaded with other drugs used against lung infections, and in particular those in which the infectious agent becomes drug-resistant after the continued large doses that may be required.</p>
<p>“Using nanoparticles to deliver drugs to a local site of infection is a promising strategy for overcoming side effects, increasing treatment efficacy, and overcoming resistance. The nanoparticles we have developed have a number of advantages as drug carriers; they do not provoke a toxic effect, they are highly stable, they release the drug over a sustained period, and they can overcome cellular barriers. We believe that our formulation shows promise to improve the antibacterial efficacy which could help patients with lung infections, since the antibiotic can reach the infection site directly and therefore decrease the side effects we see during traditional routes of administration,” Dr Carvalho-Wodarz will conclude.</p>

<p><strong>Estoril, Portugal:</strong> Researchers in the UK have, for the first time, shown how exhaust pollution from diesel engines is able to affect nerves within the lung. Air pollution is a significant threat to health, they say, and identifying potential mechanisms linking exposure to diesel exhaust and the exacerbation of respiratory diseases may lead to treatments for those affected.<br /><br />Mr. Ryan Robinson, a PhD student at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, UK, will tell the 13th European Respiratory Society Lung Science Conference today (Saturday) about his work studying diesel exhaust particles and airway sensory nerves. The news comes as the Healthy Lungs for Life campaign, launched by the European Respiratory Society and European Lung Foundation, takes places this year aiming to raise awareness of the importance of breathing clean air. <br /><br />Diesel exhaust is a significant component of urban air pollution, containing a complicated mixture of gases and airborne particles. “Studies have shown that exposure to these diesel particles is associated with harmful health effects,” says Mr. Robinson. “These particles are very small – down to 20 nanometres in diameter - and are therefore not only invisible to the naked eye, but can penetrate deep into the lungs.”<br /><br />The lungs contain numerous sensory nerves that can detect potentially harmful stimuli and thus allow the body to respond, for example by triggering a cough. “However, we know that these nerves can also be involved in exacerbating respiratory conditions, for example by causing the bronchi to constrict in diseases such as asthma,” says Mr. Robinson<br /><br />The researchers, who included Mr. Robinson’s supervisors Professor Maria Belvisi, Professor Terry Tetley and Professor Alexandra Porter, found that the diesel particles from a forklift truck could activate airway sensory nerves in an in vivo anaesthestised guinea pig model. “It was interesting to see that the more chemically sensitive airway nerves were involved, rather than the mechanically sensitive ones,” says Mr. Robinson. <br /><br />The researchers then used an in vitro isolated nerve preparation that allowed them to probe the mechanisms involved more rapidly. “The first thing we noted was that the particles, when cleaned, were harmless. It was clear that the chemicals isolated from an organic extraction of the diesel particles were key to the activation of the nerve, which backed up the data we saw in vivo,” he will tell the conference.<br /><br />To understand how the diesel extract activated the airway nerves, the researchers used pharmacological and genetic knock out tools. “It is widely known that the environmental sensors known as transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are key to airway sensory nerve activation, so we decided to block a variety of different channels to discover whether an extract of diesel could activate any of them,” he will say.<br /><br />The researchers found that the responses to the diesel extract were driven by activation of the TRP ankryin-1 (TRPA1) channel. They also discovered that the application of an antioxidant abolished the responses to the extract. “Oxidative stress, an imbalance between disturbances in the normal oxidative state of cells and the system's ability to repair the resulting damage, is linked to many diseases and is a known TRPA1 activator,” says Mr Robinson.<br /><br />This research is, however, only a first step towards understanding how air pollution may be affecting airway sensory nerves and respiratory reflexes. Whether other types of fuel activate airway nerves remains to be seen, and it is even possible that they may have a far more potent effect in this area than diesel. It will also be crucial to determine whether increased activation of sensory nerves explains why some are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution than others, the researchers say.<br /><br />“We hope that our work may lead to treatments or management strategies than can help those with respiratory diseases such as asthma that are particularly affected by air pollution,” says Mr. Robinson. “Our results indicate that our reliance on fossil fuels, and particularly diesel, could have a detrimental effect on our health, supporting the idea that we should be looking towards alternative fuel sources. We believe that our data highlight an important alternative mechanism by which diesel contributes to respiratory illness and will further influence governments in the quest to initiate change,” he will conclude.<br /><br /><strong>Notes for editors:</strong><br />The research was funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Medical Research Council (MRC), Asthma UK and the European Research Council (ERC).<br /><br /><strong>Poster title:</strong> Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) initiate sensory reflex events via activation of transient potential receptor ankrin-1 (TRPA1) ion channels <br /><strong>Presentation time:</strong> Saturday 14 March 2015, 11:40-14:30<br />Authors: Ryan Robinson, Sarah Maher, Michael Wortley, Alexandra Porter, Eric Dubuis, John Adcock, Shu Chen, Terry Tetley, Sheng Hu, Mark Birrell, Sara Bonvini, Maria Belvisi. </p>

5003;Latvian Ministerial Conference puts spotlight on TB elimination;latvian-ministerial-conference-puts-spotlight-on-tb-elimination;"<p>The first Eastern Partnership Ministerial Conference on TB and MDR-TB was held in Riga, Latvia this week focusing on TB elimination in Europe.</p>
<p>Under the Latvian presidency of the Council of the European Union, the conference brought together representatives from a number of stakeholders to discuss how we can ultimately eliminate TB and MDR-TB from Europe through sustainable health systems and political commitment.</p>
<p>Professor Ivan Solovic spoke at the event as an ERS representative and shared his perspective on the role medical societies can play in supporting TB elimination across the continent.</p>
<p>Held from 30–31 March 2015, the key objectives of the meeting were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to reducing the burden of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and to ultimately eliminate TB and MDR-TB in Europe</li>
<li>Boost multi-sectoral and cross-regional approaches in TB prevention and care, with a focus on vulnerable communities and trans-boundary transmission, while respecting human rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Professor Solovic commented: “ERS is committed to fighting this disease and supporting efforts to eliminate TB. All stakeholders have a role to play and it is essential that we work together on effective interventions that can address this serious public health threat. This conference is an important step towards this goal.”</p>
<p>The conference delegates were invited to adopt the Riga Declaration on Tuberculosis, which was negotiated through a broad consultative process among the representatives of participating countries and organisations prior to the conference.</p>

5006;Study finds marker for identifying early stage non-small cell lung cancer patients needing further treatment;study-finds-marker-for-identifying-early-stage-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-patients-needing-further-treatment;"<p>Researchers in the USA have identified a marker that could help distinguish which patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should receive post-surgical therapy.</p>
<p>The researchers retrospectively analysed pre-operative and follow-up data from 336 patients who had undergone flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) prior to surgery. FDG uptake was expressed as maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), and median follow-up time was 5.1 years.</p>
<p>The results showed that the risk of dying and recurrence of cancer decreased significantly as SUVmax decreased (p=0.0008 and p=0.24, respectively). It was estimated that at 5 years 41% of the patients in the 3rd quartile of SUVmax will be alive compared to 77% in the lowest SUVmax group.</p>
<p>The researchers believe the association between the uptake of FDG and increased overall survival rates and time to recurrence could help clinicians identify which patients should receive further therapy, such as chemotherapy, to prolong their survival time.</p>

<p>Globally, child deaths have almost halved since WHO set the Millennium Development Goals in 1990. However, despite a 30% reduction in pneumonia deaths, the disease still kills 2,600 children every day: 15% of all deaths in under-fives.</p>
<p>A lack of access to medication, poor nutrition and a lack of immunisation are some of the factors that contribute to the numbers above. Around two thirds of children do not have access to the antibiotics required to treat the bacterial infection and only 25% are vaccinated fully. Vaccination schemes often struggle to reach children living in remote, rural settings and dense, urban slum areas.</p>

This could make the inhalation of nicotine more palatable and therefore increase the likelihood of smoking uptake.</p>
<p>Around 90% of tobacco products currently contain some level of menthol whereas only around 25% are sold as menthol flavoured. In 2014 the EU agreed a ban on these 25%, the details of implementation are currently being discussed by member states, and the US federal government is considering this option.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal Molecular Pharmacology, examined menthol’s effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This was studied using recombinant human nAChRs and native nAChRs in mouse sensory neurons. The results found that desensitisation was increased when menthol is co-applied with nicotine.</p>
<p>This suggest the effect of menthol may cause smokers to feel less discomfort when inhaling. Further investigation would be required to see if this leads to deeper inhalation.</p>

ResMed, who sponsor the trial, have released a field safety notice on 13 May 2015, after early results indicated a 10% annual risk of cardiovascular death in ASV patients.</p>
<p>Patients with heart failure and central sleep apnoea (CSA), including Cheyne–Stokes Respiration (CSR) have an impaired survival compared with heart failure patients without CSA/CSR. Several observational studies found improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), oxygen saturation and normalisation of breathing disturbances during sleep under ASV.</p>
<p>The impact of ASV on survival was investigated in the SERVE-HF study, an international, multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial. The study aimed to assess whether ASV added to optimal cardiologic treatment improves survival in patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure New York Heart Association functional class II – IV and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45% and predominant CSA/CSR compared with optimal cardiologic treatment alone.</p>
<p>The results indicated a 10% annual risk of cardiovascular death in ASV patients compared with 7.5% in the control group. The overall survival and hospitalisation rate was not different between the groups.</p>
<p>These results relate only to patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction ≤45% and predominant CSA/CSR. The results do not regard patients with less severe or without heart failure and patients with other indications for treatment with ASV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=5562"">released a special safety notice</a>&nbsp;on 15 May 2015, including recommendations for the approach to patients with heart failure and predominant central breathing disturbances, who are newly diagnosed or under treatment with ASV. The AASM recommends:</p>

<p>A new study has found an effective way to deliver statin drugs to the lung.</p>
<p>A number of studies have shown that statins may be an effective therapy for asthma; however, previous studies have been unable to confirm that the drug, which is prescribed to be taken orally, has reached the lungs.</p>
<p>The new research, published in the open access journal Physiological Reports, tested whether delivering statins by inhalation would improve asthma symptoms in mice. The researchers used a novel mass spectroscopy method to measure the levels of statins in lung tissue.</p>
<p>The results suggest that direct delivery of statins to the lungs reduced over-sensitivity to allergens, had modest anti-inflammatory effects and reduced overproduction of mucus.</p>
<p>Researchers noted that dosage and specific effects are yet to be fully determined but targeted delivery could mean a lower dose would need to be administered.</p>

5038;European Week Against Cancer and World No Tobacco Day;european-week-against-cancer-and-world-tobacco-day;"<p>This week, cancer research, diagnosis and treatment are in the spotlight for policy makers and the public across Europe with the European Week Against Cancer (25 – 31 May) and World No Tobacco Day (31 May, 2015).</p>
<p>ERS is committed to improving both these issues. The Society has a long tradition of activities in the field of lung cancer. Most recently, we published a new <a href=""http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2015/04/29/09031936.00033015"">white paper</a> on lung cancer screening recommending wider lung cancer screening programs and the establishment of a central registry, preferably on a European level.</p>
<p>We have a wide range of learning resources on smoking cessation and are committed to promoting plain packaging. One billion people across the world regularly smoke tobacco. Research has shown that cigarette packets with plain packaging are less attractive to consumers. Importantly, research with young adults confirmed that plain packs increased their negative perceptions of smoking. Considering that 70% of smokers start before the age of 18, and 94% before the age of 25,&nbsp;plain packaging could be crucial in cutting these preventable deaths.</p>
<p>Encouraging people to stop is the single most cost effective health intervention we can make. That is the case with lung cancer and countless other health problems. On World No Tobacco Day (31 May, 2015), the <a href=""http://www.firsnet.org/news-and-actions/37-global-lung-health-forum-calls-for-international-support-for-plain-packaging-legislation"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"" color=""#0066cc"">Forum of International Respiratory Societies</span></span></a> (FIRS) is mobilising its members to raise awareness of the health benefits of plain packaging for cigarettes.</p>
<p>With lung cancer remaining the biggest cancer killer and smoking related diseases continuing to put great strain on healthcare systems, these two awareness events need to have a big impact on our international and local approaches to health.</p>

5039;ICS use in COPD may decrease risk of death from pneumonia;ics-use-in-copd-may-decrease-risk-of-death-from-pneumonia;"<p>Patients with COPD using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may experience increased instances of pneumonia, but the ICS may decrease their risk of death from pneumonia.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society last week, a team from University of Florida College of Medicine presented meta-analysis of 38 studies and found there was no increase in pneumonia-related mortality or overall mortality.</p>
<p>The study sought randomized controlled trials and observational studies involving COPD patients using ICS and patients who were not. Analysis of 29 randomised controlled and 9 observational trials found that the estimated unadjusted risk of pneumonia was increased in both types of study.</p>
<p>Past studies have indicated a combined immunosuppressive effect and potent anti-inflammatory effect of ICS which could explain this finding. Lead author Ena Gupta, MD, MPH, suggested that the data can be used “to weigh the overall risks and benefits of ICS use in COPD patients.""</p>

<p>Over 2,000 schools have closed and thousands of people have been quarantined since the first case of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was confirmed in South Korea on 20 May.</p>
<p>The South Korean government announced this week that it would be using mobile phone location data to monitor quarantines. Choi Kyung-hwan, the Deputy Prime Minister of South Korea, told a news briefing that this measure was “unavoidable” to protect the population.</p>
<p>The South Korean health ministry announced it had sequenced the virus on 6 June and found it was almost identical to forms seen in the Middle East. This outbreak&nbsp;is not dissimilar in nature to those seen on the Arabian Peninsula, according to Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO scientist,&nbsp;and does not signify a change in the way the virus was being transmitted.</p>
<p>The virus does not currently pass easily between people; all infections are currently traceable back to the first MERS-CoV patient in South Korea. As of Friday 5 June, 29 of the 36 then confirmed cases had been contracted at one hospital at the time of writing MERS-CoV has continued to be a hospital based infection. Tracking and quarantining the contacts of all those who have been infected is currently underway. Choi said he was confident the outbreak could be controlled as the infections were occurring in clinics and hospitals, rather than communities.</p>
<p>The EU PREPARE project, in which ERS is a partner, aims to improve international readiness for pandemics by developing the ability to compare patients by use of a common protocol for sampling and data collection. Since September, PREPARE has been looking at two key questions for MERS-CoV: What is the spectrum and evolution of symptoms in different patient groups (with and without comorbidities), and, what are the kinetics of shedding and immune response, in relation to symptoms? It is still not understood how the virus passes from camels to humans, nor why other countries with large camel populations, such as Somalia and Kenya, are not reporting cases of MERS-CoV.</p>
<p>WHO is encouraging all member states to remain vigilant for unusual patterns in acute respiratory conditions. The early symptoms of MERS-CoV are not distinctive and so standard precautions must be taken in a consistent manner.</p>

<p>Phages designed in this way could be used on hospital surfaces and in hand sanitisers in a broad process to replace antibiotic-resistant pathogens with bacteria sensitive to treatment.

<p>Published online in the <em><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.201503-0426OC#.VXqPb_lVhBc"">American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</a></em>, the Canadian study looked at 6,000 adults with CAP and 30,000 matched controls.</p>
<p>Results found that regardless of the age of the CAP patient, their subsequent morbidity and mortality rates were increased. CAP caused the greatest proportional change in patients under the age of 25, despite this group having the lowest mortality rate. Relative to controls, patients under the age of 25 saw their mortality rate double.</p>
<p>Across the cohorts, CAP patients were significantly more likely to visit emergency departments, and had higher rates of all-cause hospitalisation and higher rates of CAP-related hospital visits.</p>
<p>The study is the longest and largest study of the subject to date. Commenting on the implications of the research, author Dr Dean Eurich, from the University of Alberta, Canada, said: ""Future research may help explain the factors underling these increased long-term risks in CAP patients and inform a treatment approach in these patients."" He also highlighted that vaccination programmes may be more important and more cost effective than previously thought.</p>";50;17.06.2015 06:43

<p>The team at the University of Philadelphia hypothesised that the low-grade systemic inflammation seen in obese individuals made the lung more vulnerable to acute injury.</p>
<p>In a study of obese mice, they found that blood vessels in the lung had fewer junction proteins and were looser than normal, which could allow fluid to seep into the lungs. The vessels also produced up to 50% more adhesion cells than in the non-obese mice, meaning immune cells were pulled into tissues, exacerbating inflammation.</p>
<p>The team also tested serum from the obese mice in normal lung blood vessels and observed the same changes. This indicated that an element from the blood of the obese mice was causing the effect.</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted by the group had suggested the adiponectin protein may be the factor linking ARDS and obesity; obese individuals produce far less of the protein.</p>
<p>In this new study the team restored the adiponectin levels in the obese mice using gene therapy and found that this correlated with a decreased risk of ARDS.</p>
<p>Further studies would be required to confirm the link between adiponectin levels and vulnerability to ARDS also occurred in obese humans. If this link were to be shown, drugs are already available to increase adiponectin levels and this could lead to a new treatment avenue.</p>

<p>Entitled ‘Personalising respiratory care in Europe’, the event looked at how information and communication technology, together with a move towards precision medicine, is revolutionising healthcare and making health systems more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>A welcome address was provided by Michael Hübel, Head of the Programme Magement and Diseases Unit for the European Union’s Health and Food Safety Directorate General. Mr Hübel considered how respiratory diseases and associated risk factors are addressed across EU health policies.</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, a number of key topics were covered from all perspectives. The political perspective was offered from Dr Tapani Piha, Head of the EU’s eHealth and Health Technology Assessment Unit, who examined how ehealth can be promoted across Member States for the benefit of connecting national health systems.</p>
<p>Examples of successful ehealth projects in progress were also shared including the experience of the digitised healthcare model at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel and the experience of the icoach app, which has helped thousands of Europeans quit smoking as part of the Ex-Smokers are Unstoppable campaign.</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to specific examples of self-management of disease and new actions from industry. Dr Thomas Ferkol, President of the American Thoracic Society and Dr Alvar Agusti ended the last session of the day sharing examples of how targeted treatments are personalising care. A lively discussion followed the session on the impact of this shift in healthcare.</p>
<p>The second day of the Summit addressed balancing the development of innovative medicine with the protection of sensitive personal data, looking at core issues of data protection and regulation. Beth Thompson from the Wellcome Trust in the UK took participants through the legislative process concerning EU data protection regulation and what this means for the research community. The debate centred on how the research community can reassure patients about data protection concerns.</p>
<p>Patient ambassador for the Lung Foundation Netherlands, Dominique Hamerlijnck, concluded that while the principle of empowering patients through apps was a good one, the apps currently available fall short of delivering this aim. Her talk concluded with the proposal that apps should be developed by multidisciplinary teams involving all stakeholders, to offer the customised support required by all parties.</p>
<p>The final session of the Summit put a spotlight on ERS actions on mhealth and ehealth using examples from the field of tuberculosis (TB) and smoking cessation. The Summit concluded with an in-depth discussion on the issues surrounding personalised care and new technologies. The issue of health inequalities was raised and participants questionned how stakeholders can ensure that technological advances are accessible to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Elisabeth Bel summarised the meeting: “As more digital technologies develop, there is no better time to bring together all stakeholders to work on strategies to effectively implement ehealth and personalise the care we provide to patients.</p>
<p>“We have seen through these discussions that technological advances can facilitate and promote personalised medicine bringing the benefits of empowering patients, improving the treatment process and reducing the burden of chronic diseases. However, there are issues that are not yet resolved such as the barriers of costs and health inequalities. For example, we have to ensure that these advances are available to all sections of society and not just those people who have access to digital technologies.</p>
<p>“This interactive meeting provided a platform to bring together healthcare professionals with industry, policymakers and patients, to hold positive discussions on how we can utilise technological advances to personalise care for respiratory patients. The move towards personalising medicine is happening now so the challenge is how we can try to direct this change in the right direction. ERS is committed to embracing these changes and we hope we can succeed in the aim by sharing knowledge and working collaboratively.”</p>

5065;Exhaled breath monitoring could be used to detect pneumonia in intensive care ;exhaled-breath-monitoring-could-be-used-to-detect-pneumonia-in-intensive-care-;"<p>The results of a new proof-of-concept study show that surveillance of exhaled breath could be used to detect pneumonia in an intensive care setting.</p>
<p>Given that the current options for lab testing of samples from patients in intensive care can take days, broad-spectrum antibiotics are often prescribed based on the patient’s symptoms. The findings, published in Thorax, suggest that breath analysis could speed up the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and allow for improved selection of the optimal antimicrobial drug regimen.</p>
<p>The study included data from 46 patients with sterile brain injury. Samples were collected three times per week from admission to a maximum of 10 days, using bronchial lavage followed by breath sampling. The breath samples were analysed offline using thermal-desorption, gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>The results showed breath volatile analysis could accurately classify profiles of patients with and without bacterial infection in the lower respiratory tract, by identifying the presence and absence of pathogens.</p>
<p>The team hopes to develop a non-invasive system for breath analysis and point of care surveillance that could be part of the standard connections used on mechanical ventilators.</p>

5067;Encouraging findings for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis;encouraging-findings-for-gene-therapy-in-cystic-fibrosis;"<p>A new study has found a small but significant treatment effect from administration of a pGM169/GL67A gene–liposome complex. The results showed that the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of those who received the therapy stabilised, whereas it declined in the placebo group.</p>
<p>The double-blind study comprised 140 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 12 or over across two sites in the United Kingdom. 62 were selected, via a computer-based randomisation, to receive a placebo and 78 received the gene–liposome complex. Both treatments were administered every four weeks over the course of a year.</p>
<p>The results, published online ahead of print in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, show a modest difference only between the two groups and are perhaps unlikely to lead directly to new treatment pathways. However, the trial does show that the administration of non-viral CFTRgene therapy&nbsp;is safe and may help to progress translational cystic fibrosis gene therapy.</p>

5070;New Guidelines for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ;new-guidelines-for-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-;"<p>Updated guidelines on the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been released by an international group of leading respiratory societies.</p>
<p>The guidelines are a review of the current evidence on available IPF treatments. The evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, with recommendations rated as either “strong” or “conditional” where conditional recommendations are synonymous with weak recommendations.</p>
<p>The new guidelines provide an update from those published 2011 and include strong recommendations against four named agents for the treatment of IPF: Anticoagulation (warfarin); Imatinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor against platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors; combination prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine; and selective endothelin receptor antagonist (ambrisentan). The guidelines provide conditional recommendations for Pirfenidone and for Nintedanib which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and PDGF receptors.</p>
<p>There is also a new conditional recommendation against Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil) and dual endothelin receptor antagonists (macitentan, bosentan). Two recommendations remained unchanged since 2011, these were a conditional recommendation against the use of N-acetylcysteine monotherapy and a conditional recommendation for the use of antiacid therapy.</p>
<p>“Our systematic review of the available evidence on IPF treatments points to the need for additional research and long-term studies of their safety and efficacy,” said Professor Ganesh Raghu, chair of the committee that produced the guidelines. “This is especially true for treatments that received conditional recommendations in the guidelines. The guidelines empower the clinician to make the most appropriate treatment choices for the patient confronted with IPF and encourage shared decision-making with the well informed patient to choose the most appropriate treatment options tailored to the individual patient’s needs,” emphasised Raghu.</p>

5071;COPD linked to iron deficiency;copd-linked-to-iron-deficiency;"<p>An observational study published in <em>BMJ Open</em> has found that iron deficiency was more common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This deficiency was linked with worse health outcomes and suggests that further studies into whether outcomes may be improved by iron therapy may be worthwhile.</p>
<p>The study measured the prevalence of iron deficiency and the severity of the patients’ hypoxaemia. The cohort included 113 patients with COPD attending a specialist COPD clinic at a university hospital in Oxford and an age-matched and sex-matched control group of 57 healthy individuals.</p>
<p>Results showed a higher instance of iron deficiency in the COPD group: 18% compared with 5% in the control group. The cohort was almost entirely Caucasian with moderately severe COPD and the study notes that these results may vary among other ethnic groups and patients with a different disease severity.</p>
<p>COPD patients with iron deficiency were also more hypoxaemic, including when the results were adjusted for differences in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Iron plays an important role in the cell pathways that sense and respond to hypoxia and hypoxia is used as an important marker of disease severity in COPD. Depleted iron levels can also lead to a pulmonary hypertensive response to hypoxia, which is a key predictor of decreased survival in COPD.</p>
<p>The study measured levels of the peptide hormone hepcidin which is thought to be important in iron homoeostasis. Inflammation causes its levels to rise and hepcidin causes a reduction in the absorption of dietary iron. The study found that, in the COPD patients with iron deficiency, hepcidin levels were not sufficiently suppressed. The study suggested a link between this and the ‘inappropriate expression’ of the hormone thought to be connected to anaemia in chronic disease.</p>
<p>The study concludes that intravenous iron therapy should be explored as a therapeutic option as it has been shown to be beneficial in other chronic diseases in patients with iron deficiency. The team are now recruiting a two-year clinical trial to give iron intravenously to those with COPD.</p>

5072;New 3D lung simulation improves understanding of ARDS treatment;new-3d-lung-simulation-improves-understanding-of-ards-treatment;"<p><span style=""font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8080005645752px;"">16 July, 2015</span></p>
<p>A new computer model can predict the flow of liquid medication in the lungs, providing new insights into treatments for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</p>
<p>ARDS has a high mortality rate with few treatment options. Surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) can help the lungs to inflate and is often effective in premature neonates with surfactant deficiency. One study has shown promising outcomes for SRT in adults, but subsequent trails failed to show similar results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A new paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), describes a 3D lung simulation which can predict how the SRT liquid travels through the lungs and explain why the treatment fails in adults. The simulation suggested that the failure of the treatment was likely due to inadequate delivery and this was affected by different concentrations and viscosities of the liquids. The software is designed to take into account different lung sizes and medical conditions, allowing clinicians to alter variables like volume, viscosity, patient position and medication flow rate to get a personalised simulation for a critically ill patient, quickly.</p>
<p>Improvements to airway modelling have the potential to enable a move towards personalised medicine. ERS is part of a separate project producing computer and physical models of the whole airway system. The project, called AirPROM, will be able to quantify disease, predict response to treatment and understand disease progression in asthma and COPD.</p>

<p>A summary of key changes in the new Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines has been published in the <em>European Respiratory Journal</em>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;"">Previous clinical asthma guidelines have had poor uptake and these new guidelines have been specifically designed to be highly accessible and easy to implement. This new paper describes the methodology used in that process and the rationale behind the changes.</span></p>
<p>GINA sought input for the strategy report from an international group of over 50 multidisciplinary experts who reviewed previous GINA recommendations based on their evidence, clarity and feasibility for implementation into clinical practice.</p>
<p>Following this process the strategy was adapted using an approach which considered the clinical relevance of recommendations and strategies for their implementation in parallel with a review of the scientific evidence.</p>
<p>By using this approach, GINA aimed to produce a report that shows not only what treatment should be implemented but how it should be implemented. This is complemented by a more visual representation of recommendations and information throughout the report, using flowcharts and tables about issues that clinicians face when managing asthma in their day-to-day practice.</p>
<p>Importantly, the new GINA strategy report also includes evidence-based changes to several key clinical recommendations, particularly about when to initiate anti-inflammatory treatment, strategies for individualising treatment across the spectrum of asthma (not just in severe asthma), revised recommendations for written asthma action plans, and interim recommendations about patients with overlapping features of both asthma and COPD. The article in European Respiratory Journal provides a summary of and rationale for the key changes in the new GINA report.</p>
<p>ERS supports the aim of improving the accessibility of guidelines and has launched a new fellowship in guideline methodology this month, in collaboration with Cochrane and NICE.</p>

<p>Measures to help patients quit smoking are affordable for all countries, according to a new review.</p>
<p>The paper, published in <em>Addiction</em>, responded to common fears that smoking cessation programmes were too expensive by examining the cost and effectiveness of a range of measures.</p>
<p>Researchers used Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of major healthcare tobacco cessation interventions as well as analysis and evidence from ‘real world’ studies.Each measure was ranked as affordable if the cost of saving a year of life was less than the average economic output of a person in that country.</p>

<p>The Forum of International Respiratory Societies and Its Global Members Aim to Raise Awareness about Lung Cancer Risks through New Initiative.</p>
<p>In recognition of World Lung Cancer Day on August 1, ERS alongside members of the Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS), launched its World Lung Cancer Day 2015: Honour, Unite, Inspire campaign.</p>
<p>The global campaign aims to raise awareness about lung cancer, its global impact and create an educational movement of understanding lung cancer risks, as well as early treatment across the world.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases in 2012, and is responsible for nearly one in five cancer deaths. In fact, it claims more lives yearly than breast, colon and prostate cancers combined.</p>
<p>World Lung Cancer Day 2015: Honour, Unite, Inspire highlights the many risk factors to be aware of in order to detect lung cancer at the earliest stage possible. While most understand that smoking is the single greatest risk factor for lung cancer, other lesser known risk factors include environment and genetics. Environmental exposure to radon, asbestos, arsenic, beryllium and uranium have all been linked to lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer also increases with a history of cancer in another part of the body, age, family history, radiation to the chest area and lung diseases like COPD.</p>
<p>The initiative also aims to shed light on key symptoms and screening options. Symptoms include change in mucus, chest or back pain, coughing up blood and difficulty swallowing. Tests that may be used to diagnose lung cancer include chest X-rays, CT and PET scans, bronchoscopy, and needle biopsies. If you are a current or former smoker and over age 55, you may be a candidate for a low-dose CT scan screening that can offer early detection of lung cancer, potentially at its earliest stages.</p>
<p>“Treatment options for lung cancer have significantly advanced over the last few years and survival rates are increasing. We’re hopeful this international campaign will encourage people to gain awareness of their risks and increase early detection for the best possible outcomes,” said Dr. Nils E. Billo, Director of FIRS. More than 70,000 global FIRS members have united for World Lung Cancer Day 2015: Honour, Unite, Inspire, including member organizations: the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), Asociación Latinoamericana del Thorax (ALAT), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR), the European Respiratory Society (ERS), the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and the Pan African Thoracic Society (PATS). Patients, families and caregivers can download free educational resources and learn more about lung cancer, risk factors, screenings and treatment options by visiting <a href=""http://www.CHESTnet.org/WLCD"">www.CHESTnet.org/WLCD</a>.</p>

<p>The study, published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, suggests that patient segregation, improved ventilation and prospective surveillance for strains could help reduce the problem.</p>
<p>Previous research has suggested that infection can occur from person to person, rather than just from the environment. In a 2012 study published in the European Respiratory Journal, led by RESPIRE2 Fellowship candidate Timothy Kidd, results showed that 40% of infections in Australian CF patients were caused by the same two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting cross infection within the cohort.</p>
<p>This new study analysed 983 patients at 18 cystic fibrosis centres in Australia. The researchers used social network analysis maps to measure the relationship and flow of the patients. The analysis identified 531 distinct strains of P. aeruginosa in 983 CF patients. 493 unique strains were found in 373 patients and 38 shared strains in 610 patients.</p>
<p>Infection control practices between the 18 CF centres were also reviewed. The results showed that, although several centres had implemented vigilance for new shared strains of infection, only one practised this through prospective molecular surveillance. This centre had the lowest prevalence of shared strains amongst its patient cohort, suggesting that the practices reduced patient to patient infection.</p>

<p>In a retrospective cohort study published in Pediatrics, researchers reviewed national data on paediatric PH hospitalisations to identify trends in demographics, procedures performed during admission, and resource utilisation.</p>
<p>Over the period from 1997 to 2012, the proportion of paediatric PH patients with no associated congenital heart disease (CHD) grew and represented an overall majority of 56.4%. The fastest growing subgroup of PH patients with no associated CHD were children admitted to urban teaching hospitals.</p>
<p>Although in-hospital, all-cause mortality was high (5.9%) for patients with PH in 2012, the rate had significantly decreased over the period from 11.3% in 1997. However, cumulative, interest-adjusted national hospital charges increased dramatically over the 15-year period from $926 million in 1997 to $3.12 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>While the exact incidence and prevalence of paediatric pulmonary hypertension is not well-known, United Kingdom and Netherlands registry data give an incidence for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH) of 0.48-0.7 cases per million, respectively.</p>
<p>This study highlights a need for national data registries for PH to inform funding and care. The <a href=""http://www.erswhitebook.org/"">European Lung White Book</a> calls for the development of a simple, non-invasive PH diagnostic method and underlines the importance of better awareness of PH as essential for early diagnosis and management.</p>

<p>1.6&nbsp;million people are dying each year in China due to air pollution, according to a new study.&nbsp;<img src=""images/stories/China_air_pollution_-_week_34_2015.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""218"" alt=""China air pollution - week 34 2015"" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;"" /></p>
<p>The research, conducted by Berkley Earth, a non-profit organisation studying climate change and related issues, used hourly air pollution data from over 1500 sites, made available by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The research team produced pollution maps for eastern China, which was found to have the highest levels of pollution – as previously thought – but other areas also experienced significant levels; on average, 38% of people living in China were found to experience unhealthy concentrations of pollutants.</p>
<p>The data from the Chinese national reporting system focuses on six pollutants: particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The team are publishing four months of their data in <i>PLOS ONE</i>&nbsp;later this month but have also released 16 months of data on their website. The data showed that air pollution was associated with 4,000 deaths each day.</p>
<p>China’s use of coal has fallen dramatically this year despite a continued rise in the country’s GDP. In the first four months of 2015 coal use fell by 8% and carbon dioxide emissions by 5%, compared with the same period in 2014.<a href=""#first""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Air pollution affects almost every person in the world and ERS supports actions to tackle climate change, notably through the <a href=""http://www.europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-research/projects/healthy-lungs-for-life/home/"">Healthy Lungs for Life</a> ‘Breathe Clean Air’ campaign.</p>
<p>In October, the European Parliament will vote on the National Emissions Ceiling Directive strengthened by the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee in July 2015 to include binding emission reduction targets for ammonia, methane, mercury, PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide.</p>

<p>Despite the difference in their epidemic trajectories, the Ebola epidemic highlights important gaps in the global tuberculosis (TB) response.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared tuberculosis (TB) a global emergency in 1993. Ebola has caused 11,000 deaths since the epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern in August 2014, and control efforts are focused on achieving zero cases. In an editorial published in the ERJ, six major aspects of the Ebola epidemic are analysed in the context of TB strategy.</p>
<p>Among the aspects covered in the paper, the authors discuss how fragile health systems and social marginalisation affect the speed of response owing to poor early-warning systems. Healthcare system strengthening in increasingly urbanised populations and the integration of migrants into healthcare systems could mean health authorities are better placed to respond to epidemics at an earlier stage. Another key factor for all infections, highlighted by the scale of health worker deaths from Ebola, is the need to address infection control practices.</p>
<p>The editorial makes the point that, despite TB being the cause of 1.5 million deaths in the same period as the Ebola epidemic, TB has received almost no public attention.&nbsp;The WHO “end TB” strategy ambitiously aims for zero cases by 2035 but national preparedness plans are insufficient to reach that goal.</p>
<p>This comparison illustrates that the health economy is affected by all infections and a focus on improving health infrastructure should be the focus of investment over any one disease.</p>

<p>Two teams who published separate studies in Nature and Science have created a vaccine that targets multiple strains of influenza in animal studies.</p>
<p>Until now, vaccines have targeted the head region of the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein which changes rapidly, causing the need for a new vaccine to be developed and administered each year to protect populations from the virus which, according to WHO, kills 500,000 people annually.</p>
<p>The new vaccines target the stem region of HA which is much less subject to change. Previous studies have been unable to use the stem to stimulate an immune reaction in animal or human models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study published in Nature, conducted by a team from the Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA, achieved full protection in mice and high levels of protection in ferrets. The Science study, based at the Crucell Vaccine Institute in Leiden, Netherlands, also proved effective in mice and they reported that when administered to non-human primates, fever was significantly reduced and the monkeys produced a high level of antibodies.</p>
<p>Human trials for such a vaccine could still be many years away but this is a promising development in the search for a new target.</p>

<p>Patients with a respiratory infection are four-times more likely to die in hospital after an acute myocardial infarction than those without, according to research presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress this week.</p>
<p>The study retrospectively analysed four years of data from 1,907 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction. Respiratory infections were diagnosed from X-rays, clinical and analytical data. Treatments, adverse events and clinical and laboratory features were compared in patients with and without a respiratory infection.</p>
<p>Of the cohort, 6% developed a respiratory infection and these patients were associated with a worse disease course. Overall, this group had an in-hospital mortality rate over six-times higher than those without a respiratory infection. After adjusting this result for major risk-factors for cardiovascular mortality, respiratory infection could still be classed as an independent predictor of mortality with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.93.</p>
<p>The prevalence of respiratory infection in these patients is expected as respiratory infection and acute myocardial infarction have key risk factors in common, such as diabetes, older age and smoking. These findings suggest that screening people for respiratory infection when they are admitted for an acute myocardial infarction, and rapidly implementing targeted therapy, could help to minimise severe effects on patients.</p>

<p>The field trial was conducted by a team at the University of California and tested three recently developed assays for detecting multi- and extensively drug-resistant TB (M/XDR-TB) using sputum samples from 1,128 people attending TB clinics in India, South Africa and Moldova.</p>
<p>The tests showed excellent accuracy (97% to 100%) detecting resistance to the first- and second-line oral antibiotics isoniazid, rifampin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin. They were less accurate in detecting resistance to the injectable antibiotics amikacin and capreomycin, but the rate detection was still shown to be very high. The tests did not appear to be effective in detecting resistance to one injectable drug, kanamycin.</p>
<p>Improving the speed of testing is essential for helping to reduce antimicrobial resistance, and avoid exposing patients to the toxic effects of medicines that are not working. Furthermore it will aid the rapid treatment of TB, which was responsible for 1.5 million deaths in 2013 (WHO).</p>

5100;EMBARC launches first European bronchiectasis registry;embarc-launches-first-european-bronchiectasis-registry;"<p>The EMBARC (European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration) network has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) as part of the iABC (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic Fibrosis) consortium. EMBARC is creating the first European patient registry for bronchiectasis, providing a platform to improve the quality of care for patients across Europe, as well as to make it easier to develop and trial new drugs.</p>
<p>Dr James Chalmers, Chair of the EMBARC Steering Committee, said: “The launch of iABC shows what ERS can achieve. By bringing together researchers and promoting work in a neglected disease area, we are beginning a project that has great potential to improve quality of life for bronchiectasis patients in Europe and around the world.”</p>
<p>The number of deaths due to bronchiectasis is increasing and the condition is still little-understood. The <a href=""http://www.erswhitebook.org/"" target=""_blank"">European Lung White Book</a> describes bronchiectasis as “one of the most neglected diseases in respiratory medicine”.</p>
<p>The EMBARC project was the first clinical research collaboration (CRC) funded by ERS. ERS funds CRCs to bring researchers together to set clear research goals. The members of the project can then apply for further funding from other bodies to conduct their research.</p>
<p>The iABC consortium will fund the project for the next five years and grow EMBARC into a network capable of delivering clinical trials and making significant improvements in clinical care for people with bronchiectasis.</p>

5123;Lung cancer risk associated with the EBUS-TBFNA diagnostic categories;lung-cancer-risk-associated-with-the-ebus-tbfna-diagnostic-categories;"<p>A new study has found that the scoring system used for a lung cancer diagnostic procedure provides a good indication of the risk of malignancy for patients.</p>
<p>Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (EBUS-TBFNA) is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure for lung cancer that yields proven results. EBUS requires no incision and provides real-time, higher-quality imaging. The test categorises patients as benign, non-diagnostic, atypical, suspicious for malignancy or malignant.</p>
<p>To establish an association between these categories and the risk of malignancy for patients, a research team from the University of Missouri conducted a review of all records from the University of Utah of EBUS-TBFNAs of mediastinal and pulmonary hilar lymph nodes with surgical follow up.</p>
<p>136 patients who received a diagnosis following the EBUS-TBFNA procedure were evaluated. The team calculated the number of cases proven to be malignant after these patients had an open surgical procedure to confirm the whether the tissue was cancerous or benign.</p>
<p>Suspicious and malignant specimens had similar malignancy risks of 83% and 84%. Non-diagnostic and atypical specimens also had similar ratings of 42% and 40%. Overall, the test was found to have 68% accuracy in negative diagnosis and 84% accuracy in positive diagnoses. The scoring system could help professionals to better judge the risks associated with the information yielded from these procedures.</p>

<p>A new study has found that certain patients can, with clinical guidance, reduce their medication intake and preserve their asthma control at a reduced cost compared with those who maintain their current treatment level.</p>
<p>The study, published in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunolog</em>y, used data from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and is the first to assess cost savings associated with reducing asthma medication for patients with persistent asthma. Patients included in the study had completed the survey for two years. Data on asthma-related hospitalisations, systemic corticosteroid usage and rescue inhaler dispensing were used to identify those eligible for stepping down asthma controller medications.</p>
<p>Complete asthma control at the end of the two-year period was defined as no asthma hospitalisations or emergency department visits, no dispensed systemic corticosteroids and two or fewer dispensed rescue inhalers.</p>
<p>The team found that 89.4% of the eligible patients who stepped down their medication levels maintained their asthma control and 83.5% of the patients who were eligible for step down but did not reduce their medication level, maintained their asthma control. Compared with those maintaining their treatment level, the average monthly asthma-related cost saving was $34.02.</p>
<p>The GINA ‘Global strategy for asthma management and prevention’ recommends that clinicians “consider step down once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for about 3 months, to find the patient’s lowest treatment that controls both symptoms and exacerbations”. This study suggests that this step down is associated with asthma-related cost savings even when treatment aspects such as hospitalisation and emergency care are considered.</p>

<p>The findings, published in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em>, were the result of tests of four new paediatric lung allocation systems being trialled for the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.</p>
<p>Two of the models tested resulted in a significant increase in paediatric transplants.

<p>Cape Town, Glenview, Lausanne, Montevideo, New York, Paris, Tokyo, November 12, 2015. The Decade of the Lung initiative, recently launched by FIRS, serves to highlight the importance of respiratory diseases globally. &nbsp;Amongst these, pneumonia is one of the five major respiratory diseases worldwide, responsible for substantial illness in children and adults. <strong>Pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under 5 years, of hospitalisation and of health care utilisation</strong>. Almost 1 million children still die annually from pneumonia, but most deaths are preventable. Most pneumonia and deaths occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and in children under 2 years old. More than half of all deaths occur outside a health facility, indicating that limited access to care remains a challenge. Pneumonia can also lead to a decline in general health and to chronic respiratory disease.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Pneumonia is a preventable and treatable illness.</strong> The availability of new conjugate vaccines against H influenzae b (HiB) and pneumococcus (PCV) has been a great advance in reducing the global pneumonia burden in children. High coverage of PCV in children can also substantially reduce pneumonia incidence and deaths in adults, due to herd protection. However there are several LMICs where PCV has still not been introduced into the childhood immunisation schedule. Vaccines against whooping cough (pertussis), measles and diphtheria, given in the childhood immunisation schedule, are also essential to reduce the pneumonia burden. Other effective preventative strategies include optimising nutrition, promoting breastfeeding, reducing exposure to indoor air pollution or tobacco smoke, preventing HIV infection, good prenatal care and reducing poverty with access to safe water and better living conditions.</p>
<p>Effective treatment includes use of antibiotics, oxygen and referral to hospital when needed. Case management of childhood pneumonia as contained in the World Health Organisation Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) program is highly effective and can reduce mortality substantially. However, only 60% of children with pneumonia receive care at a health facility globally.</p>
<p>Prof Heather Zar, President of the Pan African Thoracic Society said “We have the tools to prevent and treat childhood pneumonia. But globally there is still lack of access to these for many children. Strengthening preventative and management strategies is a key health priority”.</p>
<p><strong>FIRS calls on governments, health care programs, clinicians, public health specialists and non-governments organisations to strengthen preventative and management strategies for pneumonia globally by:</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening health systems to improve pneumonia case management and enable better access to effective vaccines especially PCV and treatment, particularly oxygen and antibiotics</li>
<li>Optimising childhood nutrition by promoting exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age and complementary nutritious foods thereafter</li>
<li>Promoting initiatives to reduce tobacco smoking and indoor air pollution</li>
<li>Improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation</li>
<li>Reducing HIV-associated pneumonia through strengthening of prevention of mother to child programs and early use of antiretroviral therapy</li>
<li>Increasing funding for research in pneumonia</li>

<p>Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid, which are two of the most effective first-line drugs for TB. Globally, an estimated 3.3% of new TB cases and 20% of previously treated cases have MDR-TB. However, currently less than 30% of MDR-TB patients are being diagnosed due to laboratory constraints. Conventional tests are slow and can be expensive to scale up. LPAs have to potential to provide quicker and cheaper results.</p>
<p>The WHO decision is based on a two-phase non-inferiority analysis comparing two newer LPAs to the Hain Version 1 assay, which was assessed and approved by WHO in 2008. The study was conducted by the not-for-profit foundation FIND, in two supra-national reference laboratories to allow direct head-to-head comparisons of each of the two new tests to Hain Version 1. The evidence suggests that the two new assays have a similar level of effectiveness as the Hain Version 1.</p>
<p>In phase 1, 400 strains were tested and results were compared to both phenotypic DST and a composite reference standard, combining phenotypic DST and targeted sequencing results. In phase 2, 644 sputum samples were tested and results were compared to phenotypic DST only. Non‑inferiority was demonstrated for the two new LPAs for all parameters of interest for both phases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cape Town, Glenview, Lausanne, Montevideo, New York, Paris, Tokyo.&nbsp;</strong>World COPD Day is observed each year in November to highlight the burden of this chronic respiratory disease affecting more than 200 million people globally and causing about 3 million deaths annually. COPD is the sixth major cause of death and disability in low- and middle income countries and is projected to become the third cause of death by 2020. The economic burden is enormous, in the US alone total costs for COPD were estimated to be about 50 billion USD in 2010.</p>
<p>Risk factors for COPD other than tobacco smoking (active and passive) are increasingly recognized: they include among others occupational dusts and chemicals, indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with biomass in badly ventilated homes, outdoor air pollution and aging.</p>
<p>Patients with COPD have an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, respiratory infections, diabetes, anxiety and depression and lung cancer.</p>
<p>Diagnosis and adequate treatment of COPD are currently not available in many low and middle income countries. Spirometry is essential for a proper COPD diagnosis. Unfortunately this diagnostic tool is underutilized or not available in many health care settings. Patients should also have access to comprehensive treatment including smoking cessation programmes, medication for symptom relief and prevention of exacerbations, pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy as prescribed. It is critical that good quality medicines are available at affordable prices to all patients.</p>
<p>FIRS is dedicated to raise awareness among politicians, policy makers, clinicians, public health specialists, funding agencies and the general public. “COPD can be prevented and treated” said Prof Michiaki Mishima, President of FIRS, “but we need to strengthen prevention through an accelerated implementation of the WHO FCTC and MPOWER to reduce the use of tobacco in all countries and at the same time improve diagnosis and treatment strategies globally.”</p>
<p>Governments have pledged to support the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, recently launched at the UN General Assembly in New York. “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” is one of the several goals of this agenda. Improved COPD prevention and control will certainly contribute to this goal and therefore governments are encouraged to invest in these areas by allocating enough realistic budgets to improve the health care infrastructure and human resources for chronic respiratory diseases and in particular for COPD..</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Decade of the Lung (2016 – 2025), FIRS will contribute through a coordinated action to accelerate preventive and treatment strategies globally to benefit millions of patients and to reduce the burden of COPD.</p>

<p>A new study has achieved positive gene therapy treatment results for cystic fibrosis (CF) in mice and in cell cultures derived from human CF patients.</p>
<p>CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that cause dysfunctions in the channels through which chloride ions and water flow out of cells causing a buildup of thick mucus. The study, published in the <em>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</em>, explored the use of an adeno-associated virus-(rAAV) based gene therapy to restore chloride and fluid secretion in intestinal organoids derived from CF subjects and a CF mouse model.</p>
<p>The research team engineered a rAAV vector by inserting a truncated CFTR gene into the genome of a recombinant AAV viral vector combined with a short promoter (CMV173) and this was administered to the mice via their airways.</p>
<p>Co-author Professor Zeger Debyser said that following the treatment, ""most of the CF mice recovered. In the patient-derived cell cultures, chloride and fluid transport were restored"".</p>
<p>Further research is needed into whether repeat doses are necessary. The development of any treatment to the point where it could be ready for use in humans could take years. However, the results suggest that gene therapy is a promising candidate for CF treatments.</p>

<p>In a randomised controlled trial of 408 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma undergoing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) tapering and whose vitamin D levels were insufficient or deficient, participants were given either a vitamin D supplement or a placebo for 28 weeks. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that vitamin D might increase the positive effect of the ICS.</p>
<p>82% of those who received the supplements achieved vitamin D sufficiency within 12 weeks. However, this made no difference in the number of colds they experienced or how severe their colds were. In addition, African Americans in the group who received the supplements actually experienced more colds than African Americans in the placebo group.</p>
<p>The results were unexpected for the team from the University of Wisconsin who had previously published research showing a 40% reduction in asthma exacerbations when vitamin-D deficient patients took supplements to achieve normal levels. <br />Loren C. Denlinger, associate professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin, said: “Other studies of vitamin D and colds have produced mixed results. Most of those studies were conducted among healthy patients. We wanted to ask the same question of a patient population in which the impact of a cold carries greater risk.”</p>
<p>There are other reasons to recommend vitamin D supplements for asthma patients but Denlinger said, “we can’t recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colds.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Cape Town, Glenview, Lausanne, Montevideo, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Dec. 1, 2015</strong>— World AIDS Day, held annually on the first day of December each year since 1988, is an opportunity for people around the world to join in the fight, show their support for those living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and commemorate the lives of those who have died. The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS), an organization comprised of the world’s leading international respiratory societies working together to improve lung health globally, supports these efforts through research, patient care and advocacy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Although many important advances have been made in the understanding and treatment of HIV, World AIDS Day serves as an important reminder of the continuing worldwide toll of this disease. The World Health Organization estimates that HIV caused 1.2 million deaths globally in 2014, with 36.9 million people infected overall and 2 million newly infected in 2014. As of March 2015, 15 million people living with HIV were being treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), up from 13.6 million in June 2014. Patients receiving ART represent just under half of the people living with HIV globally.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“The fight against AIDS is far from over,” said American Thoracic Society President Atul Malhotra, MD. “The global response to AIDS has been successful in reducing new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths, but continued investment is needed to address the ongoing devastation caused by this disease. Treatment is increasingly challenging because the disease rapidly progresses when combined with respiratory diseases. As clinicians and researchers, we support the goal of UNAIDS to end the the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The lungs are commonly involved in AIDS, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary manifestations of AIDS may include tuberculosis (TB), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma. Globally, AIDS has led to a resurgence of TB in many low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that people who are infected with HIV are 26 to 31 times more likely to become sick with TB, which is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV. The WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 found that the number of TB deaths is now virtually equal to the number of HIV/AIDS deaths globally. Over one in three people living with HIV worldwide are affected, accounting for approximately one in four AIDS-related deaths. Pneumocystis pneumonia is another frequent cause of death in AIDS patients. Recent evidence also suggests that HIV infection may be a risk factor for both COPD and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The death toll for HIV-AIDS is over 34 million people. Members of FIRS call on governments, health care programs, clinicians, public health specialists and non-government organizations to strengthen their responses to the global burden of HIV infection and AIDS by:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: left;"">
<li>Increasing awareness of the continuing global threat of HIV-related disease.</li>
<li>Improving the health outcomes of people living with HIV through patient care and research.</li>
<li>Adequately funding research into improved treatments and treatment strategies.</li>
<li>Reducing the incidence and severity of HIV-related disease by strengthening mother-to-child transmission prevention programs and increasing the early use of antiretroviral therapy.</li>
<li>Improving HIV education in at-risk communities to reduce the incidence of new HIV infections.</li>
<li>Reducing HIV-related health disparities and inequities.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">These efforts will build on the progress that has been made in reducing AIDS-related death and morbidity.</p>

5170;Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe;air-pollution-is-the-single-largest-environmental-health-risk-in-europe;"<p>A report published this week by the European Environment Agency (EEA) states that 58,000 premature deaths could be avoided if the EU Clean Air Policy Package were agreed and fully implemented by 2030.</p>
<p>Entitled,&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/air-quality-in-europe-2015"">'Air quality in Europe — 2015 report'</a>, the publication reviews progress made towards meeting the requirements of the EU Air Quality Directives (from 2004 and 2008) based on data from official monitoring stations across Europe. The report gives an overview of population exposure to air pollutants harmful to human health, notably: particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>); ozone (O<sub>3</sub>); nitrogen dioxide&nbsp;(NO<sub>2</sub>); and benzo[<em>a</em>]pyrene (BaP).</p>
<p>The report indicates that the levels of these pollutants have been reduced by air quality policies. However, it estimates that air pollution was responsible for about 432,000 premature deaths in 2012 and that most city dwellers continue to be exposed to air pollutants at levels deemed unsafe by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The levels recommended by WHO are lower than the current EU standards. To put this in context using WHO cut off values, 87% of people living in urban areas of the EU in 2013 were exposed to PM<sub>2.5&nbsp;</sub>concentrations considered harmful to health whereas using the EU standards that value was 9%. At the end of October 2015, the European Parliament did strengthen rules on some emissions but not enough to meet the WHO recommended levels. If the EU national emission ceilings matched the WHO recommendations, it could prevent 144,000 premature deaths, the report says.</p>
<p>This week, world leaders are discussing emissions and climate change in Paris at the 21<sup>st</sup> UN Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Dr Isabella Annesi-Maesano, from the ERS Environment and Health Committee, will be there as part of the Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL) delegation, to present ERS activities to reduce air pollution and climate change.</p>

<p>The new vaccine strategy was presented by a team from the Yale Cancer Center at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology.</p>
<p>Patients with cancers of the immune system, such as multiple myeloma, are particularly susceptible to infection. Previous studies have suggested that a single, annual dose of the vaccine does not provoke a sufficient immune response to provide protection.</p>
<p>For the patients included in the study, the predicted infection rate after the single-dose vaccine was 20%. However, the influenza infection rate was 6% in those who received the two, higher doses. The research team is now conducting a larger, prospective randomised trial to further analyse the effectiveness of the strategy during the 2015–16 influenza season.</p>
<p>The study’s first author, Dr Andrew Branagan, said: ""Using an approved flu vaccine in a novel dosing schedule yielded promising results for a group of patients at high risk for infection… We suspect this strategy could benefit other cancer patient populations.""</p>

Despite these advances a serious number of adverse effects occurred within the trial.</p>
<p>The benefits of bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction with the use of one-way endobronchial valves (EBV), as a potential treatment for patients with severe emphysema across the board, have been uncertain to date. 68 patients were monitored as part of the study. All had an absence of interlobar collateral ventilation. Half of the patients were randomly assigned to the EBV group, whilst the other half were assigned to the continued standard medical care group. The patients were monitored from baseline to 6 months, noting changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced vital capacity (FVC), and 6-minute walk distance.</p>
<p>After a 6-month period, the EBV group showed significant improvements: the increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> was greater in the EBV group than in the control group by 140 ml; the increase in FVC was greater by 347 ml; and the increase in the 6-minute walk distance was greater by 74m.</p>
<p>Although the study notes significant improvements in pulmonary function and exercise capacity of the EBV, a higher number of adverse effects occurred within the EBV group when compared to the continued standard medical care group: 23 serious adverse events in the EBV group, compared to 5 in the control group.</p>

5184;Study sheds light on how drug molecules regulate protein linked to asthma;study-sheds-light-on-how-drug-molecules-regulate-protein-linked-to-asthma;"<p><img src=""images/stories/shutterstock_protein_membrane.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""240"" alt=""shutterstock protein membrane"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" />A new study has shown how various pharmaceutical drugs activate or deactivate a signalling protein linked to asthma, obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The study, recently published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a protein that sits on the cell membrane, where it binds external molecules and sends signals to the inside of the cell.</p>
<p>β2AR belongs to a class of modules called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is known that GPCRs play a crucial role in disease and 35% of pharmaceuticals currently target these receptors. In the respiratory field, β2AR is known to affect asthma and cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>In the past, studies have focused on catching snapshots of β2AR in its active and inactive forms using X-ray crystallography, which did not show frequency of activation or how different drug molecules governed the time spent in each state.</p>
<p>In this new study, researchers incorporated β2AR in ""nanodiscs"", small particles that mimic the native cell membrane but contain only a single receptor molecule. They tagged a section of the receptor with a fluorescent probe and monitored the fluorescence intensity over time in a sophisticated microscope system. The probe lit up when the receptor was inactive and went dim when active, giving the researchers a way to track activation in real time.</p>
<p>The researchers used this new method to test β2AR reactions to formoterol, an anti-asthma drug and to the drug ICI 118,551, an inverse agonist known to suppress signalling.</p>
<p>Results showed that the receptor naturally fluctuates between its active and inactive states in the absence of any drug. It was also found that the presence of formoterol does not just activate β2AR faster - it also stops β2AR from deactivating as quickly. The researchers also saw that ICI 118,551 caused β2AR to deactivate more rapidly. Together, the findings explain why β2AR exhibits some signalling activity even in the absence of any drug molecules and why different drugs can either stimulate or inhibit signalling.</p>
<p>The researchers stated that the next step after this study would be to utilise the new single-molecule florescence technology to find molecules that spark the same behaviour or to find molecule that could work on different GPCRs to affect different diseases.</p>

<p>A WHO panel of scientists and public health experts identified eight diseases for which few or no medical countermeasures are available, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).</p>
<p>WHO is developing a blueprint to accelerate research and development into these pathogens to improve diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. The blueprint will also consider behavioural interventions, and fill critical gaps in scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>In Europe, there is currently no framework for ensuring that clinical research is a core part of a response to an epidemic. When an infectious disease breaks out, it is therefore challenging to implement clinical research to investigate a rapidly emerging infection.

<p>Previous studies have looked into the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in diseases such as type 2 diabetes but not human BPD development.</p>
<p>To confirm NLRP3's role in regulating the inflammatory process of BPD, researchers used neonatal animal models exposed to 85% oxygen. The animal model was used to test two FDA-approved drugs that either block the effect or decrease the production of interleukin 1 beta.In both cases, treatment allowed more normal lung development to occur. The researchers also examined tracheal aspirate samples from premature infants to establish the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of BPD.</p>
<p>The study concluded that early activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mechanism in the development of BPD, and represents a novel therapeutic target for BPD.</p>
<p>Dr. Rashmin Savani, Professor and Chief of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, and senior author of the study, said: ""Our findings suggest that if we target premature infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation from three to 10 days after birth with this therapy, we might be able to drastically reduce or even eliminate the development of BPD.""</p>
<p>Next steps include testing the therapeutic intervention strategies outlined in this study in larger animal models, potentially followed by a Phase 1 clinical trial.</p>

<p><img width=""300"" height=""279"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" alt=""ozone"" src=""images/stories/ozone.PNG"" />A study has found that adults with long-term exposure to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) may have increased risk of dying from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, researchers examined the cause of death over a 22-year period for more than 237,000 participants using data taken from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study (CPS-II). They also looked at levels of fine particulate (PM2.5) pollution, an established cause of premature mortality, and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) pollution, which has been linked to premature mortality.</p>
<p>The study found that for every additional 10 parts per billion (ppb) in long-term ozone exposure, the risk of dying increased by 12% from lung disease, 3% from cardiovascular disease, and 2% from all causes. The study noted that the increased risk of death was highest for diabetes (16%), followed by dysrhythmias, heart failure and cardiac arrest (15%) and by COPD (14%).</p>
<p>Based on the annual 8-hour average, researchers found the association between ozone and mortality began at 35 ppb – noting that many communities are above this level.</p>

<p><img width=""300"" height=""300"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" alt=""WCD 4"" src=""images/stories/WCD_4.jpg"" />The Forum of International Respiratory Societies and its global members aim to raise awareness about lung cancer on World Cancer Day.</p>
<p>Cape Town, Glenview, Lausanne, Montevideo, New York, Paris, Tokyo, February 1, 2016 – In recognition of World Cancer Day on February 4, the European Respiratory Society, alongside members of the Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS), support the World Cancer Day: ‘We Can. I Can.’ campaign. The global campaign highlights how everyone, as a collective or as individuals, can do their part to reduce the global burden of cancer. FIRS is also using the day to highlight the global burden of lung cancer.</p>
<p>Next year alone, nearly 9 million people are likely to die of cancer, and left unchecked, the number of deaths will increase to 13 million per year by 2030. World Cancer Day is a chance to reflect on what you can do: make a pledge and take action. Whatever you choose to do ‘We Can. I Can.’ will make a difference to the fight against cancer. The initiative outlines nine targets to be achieved by 2025 with the overarching goal to reduce cancer deaths by 25% by 2025. The targets include strengthening health systems, measuring cancer burden and impact of cancer plans in all countries, reducing exposure to cancer risk factors, universal coverage of HPV and HBV vaccination, reduction of stigma and dispelling myths about cancer, universal access to screening and early detection for cancer, improvement in access to services across the cancer care spectrum, universal availability of pain control and distress management, and improvement in education and training of healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases in 2012, and is responsible for nearly one in five deaths. While most understand that smoking is the single greatest risk factor for lung cancer, regular exposure to secondhand smoke also increases the risk. In addition, environmental exposure to radon, asbestos, arsenic, beryllium, and uranium have all been linked to lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer also increases with a history of cancer in another part of the body, age, family history, radiation to the chest area, and lung diseases like COPD and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>“We welcome occasions such as World Cancer Day to raise awareness of lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer deaths globally. Providing information to the public to aid in reduction of exposure to cancer risk factors, improving access to services across the cancer care spectrum, and strengthening health systems are all critical to improving lung cancer care and decreasing mortality.” said Prof. Michiaki Mishima, President of FIRS. <br />About the Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS).</p>
<p>The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) is an organization comprised of the world’s leading international respiratory societies working together to improve lung health globally: American Thoracic Society (ATS), American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), Asociación Latinoamericana De Tórax (ALAT), Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR), European Respiratory Society (ERS), International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and the Pan African Thoracic Society (PATS). The goal of FIRS is to unify and enhance efforts to improve lung health through the combined work of its more than 70,000 members globally.</p>

<p>The study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, looked specifically at the role ofvariation in air pollution in urban areas and the development of asthma.</p>
<p>Over 65,000 Canadian children were included in the study and followed up from birth until the age of 10 years. The researchers monitored physician-diagnosed asthma cases among this group and also assessed exposure of the mother’s to air pollutants during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Each mother’s postcode was used and exposure level was determined using three measures:</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">
<li>Land use regression models, which combine traffic-related air pollutant monitoring data and geographical information around the home address</li>
<li>Measurements of air pollutants from monitoring stations close to each mother</li>
<li>Assessing whether each mother in the study lived close to a major road.</li>
</ul>
<p>The measurements focused mainly on traffic-related pollutants, including black carbon, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and nitric oxide.</p>
<p>The findings revealed that exposure to air pollution from traffic sources during pregnancy increases the risk of developing asthma during the first 5 years of life, even in urban areas with relatively low levels of pollution. Children whose mothers lived close to highways during pregnancy had a 25% increased relative risk of developing asthma before the age of five.</p>
<p>The risk increased with an increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. In addition, children born with a low birth weight were more susceptible to the respiratory effects of air pollution. The results were found after other factors, such as low birth weight at term, gestational period, breastfeeding and socio-economic factors had been controlled for.</p>
<p>Lead author, Dr Hind Sbihi, from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said: “Our study results highlight the importance of exposure to pollution while babies are still in the womb. Air pollution from traffic sources increased the risk of developing asthma during early years before children reach school age, even in an urban area with relatively low levels of air pollution. There are some measures individuals can take to reduce this risk. First we would suggest installing high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in the home and avoiding busy routes when taking a stroll. You can also check air quality levels online and postpone high-intensity physical activity until conditions improve.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the findings, Chair of the European Lung Foundation, Dan Smyth, said: “Air pollution affects 100% of the population and this study highlights the harmful effects of air pollution right from the moment we are created. A large proportion of Europe's population live in areas with unhealthy outdoor air and it is essential that we increase awareness of the dangers of polluted air. Our Healthy Lungs for Life campaign aims to do this by focusing on measures to help prevent damaging lung conditions. Urgent action is needed to tackle the rising levels of air pollution. We believe that an ambitious EU National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive, which revises limit values for ambient air and which is currently negotiated between the EU institutions, is an essential tool to achieve this aim.”</p>

<p><img src=""images/stories/Cystic_Fibrosis.jpg"" width=""275"" height=""182"" alt=""Cystic Fibrosis"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" />Scientists have shed new light on protein interactions in cystic fibrosis, which could have possible implications for future drugs to treat the disease.</p>
<p>Published in <i>PNAS,</i> the study analysed interactions of the <span style=""color: #111111;"">cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</span> (CFTR) protein. <span style=""color: #111111;"">In healthy individuals, the CFTR protein </span>and the naturally occurring 14-3-3, interact to ensure the trafficking of the CFTR protein to the cell wall is successful. In around 70% of Caucasians diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, the cause is known to be anomalies in the CFTR protein and a failure of the protein reaching the cell wall.</p>
<p>By <span>isolating this </span>protein-protein interaction in the laboratory, scientists at <span>Eindhoven University of Technology and McGill University discovered that the naturally occurring fusicoccin-A can stabilise the interaction between 14-3-3 and CFTR, by selectively interacting with the mutant CFTR, which in turn stimulates the trafficking of CFTR to the cell wall. </span></p>
<p>This new finding could lead to drug development in the future as the mechanism described in the paper could act as a model for the development of new trafficking corrector molecules to treat cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px;"">Beta blockers are primarily used to treat stress or heart problems, such as high blood pressure and angina, but these new findings suggest they could have a potential benefit for patients with COPD.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px;"">COPD exacerbations involve a worsening of symptoms, in particular increased breathlessness. Although beta blockers are suspected to tighten the muscles in the airways, contributing to breathing problems, previous research has suggested beneficial effects of β-blocker use in patients with COPD. This study aimed to understand this link and to analyse if any potential benefit on exacerbations existed for COPD patients taking the drug.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px;"">The research, presented today (12 March, 2016) at the European Respiratory Society’s Lung Science Conference, analysed health records of 1,621 COPD patients included in the Rotterdam Study. Patients were followed until an exacerbation occurred and researchers collected data on the use of different kinds of beta-blockers and whether the patient also experienced heart failure.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px;"">The findings revealed that the use of cardio selective beta-blockers, which are primarily used to treat heart disease, reduced the relative risk of exacerbations by 21%. The benefits were increased for patients with heart failure who saw a reduced risk of 55%.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px;"">Lies Lahousse, lead author and FWO postdoctoral fellow from Ghent University Hospital in Belgium, commented: “The overlap in symptoms and risk factors associated with lung and heart disease can be complicated and we know that a reduction in lung function is also associated with a reduction in heart function. These preliminary findings offer a useful insight into the potential benefits of beta blockers for patients living with heart disease at the same time as COPD. If randomised controlled trials confirm our findings, we could see promising clinical implications.”</p>

The map works by dividing asthma into different subgroups in order to allow personalised treatment more targeted to the type of asthma patients live with.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.3em;"">Details of the AsthmaMap were presented in Estoril, Portugal today (12 March, 2016) at the European Respiratory Society’s Lung Science Conference.</span></p>
<p>In other disease areas, the Parkinson’s disease map and the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network, have already begun the process of integrating knowledge about the involved mechanisms in order to understand the different subtypes of these diseases. The AsthmaMap is the first detailed representation of the different molecular processes involved in asthma.</p>
<p>The current “one-size-fits-all” approach to healthcare, in which there are standard treatments for single conditions, means that many patients take medication that does not improve their symptoms. An emerging field, known as “systems medicine”, is harnessing the use of new technologies to gather big data sets on many patients in different disease areas, to understand how diseases affect people differently.</p>
<p>Systems medicine involves the analysis of data at every level (cellular, organ-level, whole organisms, environmental factors). This allows researchers to identify all of the components that play a role in a disease, with the ultimate aim of understanding the different subtypes of different diseases and being able to better target therapies and treatments.</p>
<p>The AsthmaMap has used data on known disease mechanisms from other studies and projects, including the EU-funded U-BIOPRED project, with the results reviewed, edited and mapped by numerous experts. The AsthmaMap is the first integration of the known processes involved in the development of asthma based on a consensus view of asthma. Researchers working on the map have demonstrated how it can be used as a resource and teaching aid.</p>
<p>Dr Alexander Mazein, lead author of the study from the European Institute for Systems Biology and Medicine, commented: “In-depth understanding of asthma means redefinition of asthma subtypes based on the mechanisms that lead to the development of the disease. This translates into more accurate diagnostics, new therapy strategies and the development of patient-focused drugs that can target the different subgroups of asthma. The AsthmaMap is a key step forward in our move towards a personalised approach to healthcare in the respiratory field. While it will primarily be used for research purposes at this stage, we anticipate that once validated, the tool can be used by clinicians as they are treating patients.”</p>

5232;New developments could allow doctors to virtually see inside the lungs of patients;new-technology-could-allow-doctors-to-virtually-see-inside-the-lungs-of-patients;"<p>New developments in scan technology could enable space inside the lungs to be visible on a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.</p>
<p>Experts have developed a process using specially-treated krypton gas as an inhalable contrast agent to make the spaces inside the lungs show up on a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. It is hoped the new process will eventually allow doctors to virtually see inside the lungs of patients.</p>
<p>Traditional magnetic resonance imaging uses hydrogen protons in the body as molecular targets to give a picture of tissue but this does not give a detailed picture of the lungs because they are full of air. Recent technological developments have led to a novel imaging methodology called Inhaled Hyperpolarised Gas MRI that uses lasers to 'hyperpolarise' a noble (inert) gas, which aligns (polarises) the nuclei of the gas so it shows up on an MRI scan.</p>
<p>The work will make 3D imaging using 'atomic spies' like helium, xenon, or krypton possible in a single breath hold by the patient. In the new paper, researchers have developed a technique to generate hyperpolarised krypton gas at high purity, a step that will significantly facilitate the use of this new contrast agent for pulmonary MRI.</p>
<p>Author of the paper, Professor Thomas Meersmann from the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre at Nottingham University in the UK, said: ""It is particularly demanding to retain the hyperpolarized state of krypton during preparation of this contrast agent. We have solved a problem by using a process that is usually associated with clean energy related sciences. It's called catalytic hydrogen combustion. This development significantly improves the potential usefulness of laser-pumped krypton-83 as MRI contrast agent for clinical applications.""</p>

<p><strong>24 March 2016 - Cape Town, Glenview, Lausanne, Montevideo, New York, Paris, Tokyo</strong><br /> <img src=""images/stories/FIRS.jpg"" width=""275"" height=""119"" alt=""FIRS"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" /><br />In support of World TB Day, 24 March, the Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) calls for united efforts to mobilise the financial and human resources to end tuberculosis (TB).</p>
<p>World TB Day this year comes on the cusp of a new era driven by the Sustainable Development Goals and other ambitious plans, such as those set by the End TB Strategy and the Global Plan to End TB, 2016-2020, which together aim to end TB as a global health problem by 2035. To meet this goal, we must bring about a paradigm shift in the global fight against TB. We cannot continue with business as usual.</p>
<p>TB is curable in the vast majority of cases, and yet slow progress against the disease means that it now kills more people annually than any other communicable disease. According to the World Health Organization, 9.6 million people developed TB in 2014 and 1.5 million people died from the disease. This includes 1 million children who became sick with TB and 140,000 who died as a result. Approximately one in three people who develop TB are never even diagnosed.</p>
<p>The massive numbers of people developing TB disease each year arise from the fact that up to one in three people worldwide may be living with a latent TB. People have a right to know their TB status and receive treatment for latent TB before the infection has an opportunity to advance to active disease. We need greater investment in efforts to provide screening and treatment for latent TB targeted toward those at high risk.</p>
<p>The fight against TB is being hampered by a crisis caused by the spread of deadly drug-resistant strains. The spread of multidrug-resistance TB (MDR-TB) represents one of the biggest threats to eliminating TB. Of the 480,000 people who developed MDRTB in 2014, three quarters of them did not know their TB was resistance. Only half of people diagnosed with MDR-TB are treated successfully.</p>
<p>With the elimination of tuberculosis as the goal, we need to unite to find the critical investments needed in drug and vaccine development, new programmes for diagnosis and treatment, community-led solutions, and the crucial protection of the health workers who put themselves at risk every day. Governments and private-sector partners must work together to invest US $2 billion annually in the research and development of new TB diagnostics, medicines and a vaccine.</p>
<p>This year’s World TB Day theme is ‘Unite to End TB.’ The Global Plan to End TB 2016-2020 lays out the steps we must take together to put the world on track to end TB. FIRS calls on all countries of the world to take the actions necessary to implement the plan, which provides guidance based on local epidemiological trends, rooted in human rights and gender equity, that delivers people-centred treatment and care with a focus on communities most heavily impacted by TB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About FIRS</strong></p>
<p>The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) is an organization comprised of the world's leading international respiratory societies working together to improve lung health globally: American Thoracic Society (ATS), American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), Asociación Latinoamericana De Tórax (ALAT), Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR), European Respiratory Society (ERS), International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and the Pan African Thoracic Society (PATS). The goal of FIRS is to unify and enhance efforts to improve lung health through the combined work of its more than 70,000 members globally.</p>

5239;How can we improve awareness about air pollution and occupational lung disease? ;how-can-we-improve-awareness-about-air-pollution-and-occupational-lung-disease-;"<p><span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.3em;"">E<img src=""images/stories/Alex.jpg"" width=""275"" height=""155"" alt=""Alex"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" />xperts have gathered in Brussels this week to take part in two workshops aiming to improve the communication of air pollution risk and education around occupational lung diseases.</span></p>
<p>Air pollution has major adverse effects on health. Although information is available, there is a lack of behaviour-change advice. Patients and the public remain confused about how they can avoid the harm caused by air pollution and clinicians do not routinely discuss this with their patients. For example, what is the risk for an asthmatic on a high pollution day – and how should it be presented? The workshops aims to develop evidence-based advice for patients, and the public, alongside recommendations for policymakers responsible for pollution control.</p>
<p>Professor Bert Brunekreef, Chair of the ERS Health and Environment Committee, commented: “This two-day event provided an essential platform to deliver much-needed information on air pollution risks. Although it is widely understood that air pollution is harmful, we do not have consistent, readily-available advice to help patients change their behaviour and to facilitate sustainable legislation from policymakers. The outcomes of this workshop will provide invaluable information and resources to remedy this problem.”</p>
<p>Current and future challenges exist in the field of occupational lung disease: the structure of industries, the workforce demography and diminishing role of governmental organisations will all have an impact on occupational respiratory disease.</p>
<p>The workshop aims to provide an overview of the progress in the field of occupational respiratory diseases and prevention over the years, knowledge about the current and future needs in the field of occupational respiratory diseases and recommendations to employers, employees and policy-makers in the field of occupational respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>Sara De Matteis, Member of the ERS Environment and Health Committee, said: “As the occupational landscape is changing, it is vital that we assess the impact this is having on occupational respiratory diseases. There is an increasing emphasis and on employer and employee responsibility and we need to ensure that these groups of people have accurate information to make the best decisions for the benefit of an individual’s health. The workshop aims to ultimately pave the way for new tools and materials to facilitate better lung health education in the workplace.”</p>
<p>The recommendations and materials produced at both workshops will be used for the ERS/ELF Healthy Lungs for Life (HLFL) campaign this year in London and also across the globe when people carry out their own HLFL events.</p>
<p>HLFL was set up by ERS and ELF in 2014 as one of the largest ever lung health campaigns aiming to raise awareness of the importance of healthy lungs and how to protect them to healthcare professionals, scientists, primary care, patients, policy makers and the public. In 2016, the campaign will focus on the importance of clean air for lung health.</p>

<p><img src=""images/stories/Research_Agency.jpg"" width=""251"" height=""167"" alt=""Research Agency"" style=""margin: 2px; float: right;"" />As part of its 2013-2018 strategic plan, ERS is currently working on the launch of a Research Agency, which will support respiratory research across Europe.</p>
<p>A new editorial, written by the Research Agency working group, and published in the latest <em>ERJ</em> outlines the mission and vision of the Agency and the value it will add in a challenging research environment.</p>
<p>The central aim of the Research Agency is to facilitate respiratory research through the coordination and support of the respiratory research community and its efforts to obtain funding. Structured around four strategic areas of activity, the Research Agency aims to harness the experience and reputation of ERS to form an international umbrella organisation to further respiratory research. The areas are:</p>
<p>1. Standards, Guidance and Training<br />2. Supporting Researcher Career Development<br />3. Obtaining Funding, Coordinating Research Projects and Clinical Studies<br />4. Data</p>
<p>Professor Stephen Holgate, Chair of the ERS Science Council, commented: “The current environment for research is complex and challenging and we believe that there is a significant opportunity here for ERS to help improve this situation. The Research Agency will be an investment in the future of respiratory research and we believe it can have a positive impact, ultimately improving the health of respiratory patients.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, initial steps for the development of the Research Agency will commence. This will include an online survey of members’ analysing the respiratory cohorts they are currently involved with, supporting consortiums in Horizon 2020 applications, and conducting a pilot project of combining data sets in airway diseases to evaluate common treatable traits.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.3em;"">Taking place in Nairobi, alongside the annual Pan African Thoracic Society (PATS) Congress on 9–12 April, 2016, the event was supported by the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and European Lung Foundation (ELF) and focussed on offering training to health professionals through information sessions and practical workshops.</span></p>
<p>The sessions covered an overview of spirometry alongside detailed information relating to hygiene and infection considerations, the indications and contraindications in preparing for spirometry and procedure demonstrations. The practical workshops supported these topics; offering hands on calibration and procedure workshops, as well as data validation and case studies for interpretation.</p>
<p>Healthcare workers from PATS, the National TB and Lung Disease Unit of the Ministry of Health (KAPTLD), the Nairobi County Department of Health and other partnering health organisations in Nairobi also contributed to the event, where a total of 32 professionals benefitted from the sessions.</p>
<p>ERS and ELF were pleased to support the event by providing spirometry testing equipment, which was partly funded by donations made by delegates attending last year’s European respiratory Congress in Amsterdam. We would like to thank delegates for their contributions.</p>
<p>Lindsay van der Linden, who is part of the ERS Spirometry Driving Licence team, said of the event: “I am very excited about what this will mean in assisting promoting lung health and the use of spirometry on this side of the world.”</p>
<p>Prof Andy Bush, who attended the event on behalf of the ERS thought the session was “Outstanding – with standing room only.”</p>
<p>This event is one of many Healthy Lungs for Life activities planned in 2016.</p>

5251;Bacterial biomarkers predict early treatment success for TB ;bacterial-biomarkers-predict-early-treatment-success-for-tb-;"<p>Bacterial biomarkers that predict early treatment success in tuberculosis cases have been identified in a new study published in <em>BMC Medicine</em>. The findings could have positive implications for both treatment time and costs moving forward.</p>
<p>There were 9 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths from TB in 2013 and predictive biomarkers for treatment efficacy are essential to help understand how the bacilli persists through treatment in drug-resistant strains of the infection.</p>
<p>The study used genome-wide transcriptional profiling to map mRNA signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli (M.tb). The sputa of 15 patients were analysed before and 3, 7 and 14 days after the start of standard regimen drug treatment to understand why some bacteria survive through months of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The study showed for the first time that by testing patients' sputum, specific changes could be identified in M.tb two weeks after starting drug therapy that could predict the success of treatment six weeks later.</p>
<p>Dr. Simon Waddell, working with a team of researchers from the UK, South Africa and Finland said of the discovery: ""Profiling TB bacteria in this way may help find predictive markers of treatment success that are desperately needed in clinical trials and in the clinic. This would reduce the cost of drug trials needed to test new drugs for TB, and allow doctors to quickly stratify patients who are not responding to drug therapy.""</p>

5252;Action and collaboration needed for asthma, a major noncommunicable disease;action-and-collaboration-needed-for-asthma-a-major-noncommunicable-disease;"<p>&nbsp;<em>Asthma impacts 334 million people globally—a number greater than the entire population of the United States</em><span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.3em;"">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""images/stories/WAD_Poster.PNG"" width=""275"" height=""332"" alt=""WAD Poster"" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" />In support of <a href=""http://ginasthma.org/wad/"">World Asthma Day</a>, May 3, the <a href=""http://www.firsnet.org/"">Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS)</a> calls for stakeholders to collaborate to fund, develop and implement prevention and management strategies to control this major disease, <a href=""http://www.globalasthmareport.org/index.php"">impacting 334 million people globally</a>.</p>
<p>Asthma is a chronic lung disease and is a major noncommunicable respiratory disease. It affects millions of people all around the world and reduces their quality of life by limiting physical activity or contributing to lost school or work days. Asthma is common in adults and children in both high- and low-income countries.</p>
<p>In 2016, World Asthma Day reinforces the new important United Nations’ <a href=""http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/post-2015-development-agenda.html"">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, which include plans to reduce premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by one-third, through prevention and treatment. According to the <a href=""http://www.globalasthmareport.org/"">2014 Global Asthma Report</a>, avoidable asthma deaths are due to a failure to implement prevention strategies.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal in asthma, stakeholders must collaborate locally and globally to ensure adequate funding and resources are available to implement effective preventative and therapeutic strategies for this common disease.</p>
<p>The causes of asthma are not fully understood, risk factors include a genetic predisposition along with triggers, such as exposure to substances that irritate the air passages and cause allergic reactions. These include dust, pets, tobacco smoke, chemicals and air pollution. Other causes are physical exercise, certain medications, cold air and even emotions. In severe cases, asthma can also be fatal; and sadly most asthma-related deaths occur in low- and lower-middle income countries. Asthma is also expensive, accounting for significant health care costs. In Europe, the total cost of asthma in 2011 was estimated at €19.3 billion among Europeans aged from 15 to 64 years.</p>
<p>In 2016, asthma can be treated effectively.</p>
<p>• Effective management of asthma helps people to enjoy a good quality of life;<br />• Avoiding asthma triggers can reduce the severity of asthma;<br />• Medications can help control asthma; <br />• Long-term preventer medicines help reduce airway inflammation and symptoms;<br />• Reliever medications provide quick relief of acute asthma symptoms; and<br />• Knowledge and education are key to controlling asthma, and the more people know about the disease, the more effectively they can manage it.</p>
<p>Asthma is a major public health issue. Working together, health professionals and people with asthma can prevent, treat and manage asthma effectively in order to avoid negative health effects. Resources should be used optimally to ensure all people with asthma have access to effective education, prevention and medications.</p>
<p>Leaders in respiratory health must unite globally to invest in community-led solutions to improve the quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality in asthma. FIRS calls on countries and organizations around the world to invest and take necessary actions to encourage people-centred prevention, treatment and care to ensure that every person with asthma has access to high-value care.</p>

5260;Study identifies lung cancer mutations that may be responsive to immunotherapy;study-identifies-lung-cancer-mutations-that-may-be-responsive-to-immunotherapy;"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>A new study has identified a number of new driver mutations in lung cancer cells that may be responsive to genomically targeted therapies and to immunotherapy.<br />The research, recently published in Nature Genetics, examined 1,144 genome profiles of cancers from people with either lung adenocarcinoma or lung squamous cell carcinoma to identify new drivers of lung carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Of the 58 significantly mutated genes found in the cancers, only 6 mutated genes were shared by both types, which highlighted that the two cancers differ significantly from each other despite arising in the same organ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study also identified several predicted neoepitopes that may act as markers to both identify and treat lung cancer. 47% of lung adenocarcinoma and 53% of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples had at least 5 predicted neoepitopes. These figures suggest good prospects for immunotherapy, which has potential advantages over radiotherapy and chemotherapy because in principle it spares the healthy cells.</p>
<p>Lead author of the paper Joshua Campbell, postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, noted: ""We have identified several distinct recurrent mutations that are likely to be recognised by the immune system and therefore would be strong candidates for cancer vaccines.”</p>
<p>Campbell added that ""Future studies are needed to determine what allows a mutation in a gene to cause uncontrolled growth in one type of cell but not in another type. This knowledge will give us a more complete understanding of the molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and help us design better drugs.""</p>
<p>The data obtained in the study have been deposited into the most complete database of genetic alterations in cancer cells - the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC).</p>
