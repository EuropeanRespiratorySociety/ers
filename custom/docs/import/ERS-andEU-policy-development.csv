An open letter to José Manuel Barroso;an-open-letter-to-jose-manuel-barroso;"<p>ERS is one of the founding members of the <a href=""http://www.alliancechronicdiseases.org/"" target=""_blank"">European Chronic Diseases Alliance</a> (ECDA). ECDA strives to ensure that chronic diseases are recognised as an epidemic and major scourge by European policy makers and that necessary actions are taken. ECDA member societies, including ERS, have actively promoted these goals by providing policy recommendations, engaging with policy makers and raising awareness on chronic diseases.</p>
";"
<p>To keep the issue on the map, ECDA has submitted an open letter on the chronic disease challenge to José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission. The letter underscores the importance of committing to the target signed up by the World Health Assembly which concerns a 25% reduction in premature mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases by 2025. It also urges the Commission to propose an EU Strategy and Action Plan, in light of the alarming projections of chronic diseases and the downward trend in the number of people in the workforce by 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

ERS continues to make the case for stronger European and national action on chronic respiratory diseases;ers-continues-to-make-the-case-for-stronger-european-and-national-action-on-chronic-respiratory-diseases;"<p>ERS has responded to the EU Reflection Process on Chronic Disease warning that the lack of urgency to date in addressing chronic respiratory diseases has created a dire situation for sufferers. The Reflection Process, led by the European Commission Directorate General for Health and Consumers, invited contributions from stakeholders on what can be done to improve current policies and activities on chronic diseases, both at national and EU levels.</p>
";"
<p>In view of the burden of chronic respiratory disease, in its submission ERS urges the Commission to <em>form a <b>comprehensive strategy on chronic diseases</b></em><em>, </em>supported at Member State level by evidence-based disease-specific strategies adapted according to the particular priorities and situation in each country.</p>
<p>In addition, ERS calls for the 21 Member States who do not currently <b>include respiratory diseases in their national action plans to tackle chronic non-communicable diseases</b>, to step up efforts to do so and encourages them to incentivise procedures such as simple lung function tests, tobacco dependence treatment and screening for other chronic respiratory conditions.</p>
<p>ERS emphasises that <b>health inequalities</b> in the management and care of patients within and between EU countries <b>must also be addressed</b> and supports efforts to improve care, patient access and information and disease monitoring via the use of <b>modern technology</b> (such as smart phones and applications).</p>
<p>ERS calls a <b>stronger strategic biomedical research framework</b> to tackle chronic diseases. <b>Cross-fertilisation between clinical disciplines</b> is needed in order to accelerate the translation of basic science in to clinical practice and efficiently exploit basic science discoveries to tackle chronic diseases. ERS also notes that the current <b>fragmentation</b> of biomedical research in general must to be resolved in order to realise <b>resource </b>(both human and cost) <b>efficient innovation</b>.</p>
<p>In order to further boost actions to combat chronic respiratory disease, ERS suggests that the EU and Member States should actively consider <b>extending the mandate of the European Centre for Disease Control </b>(ECDC) to cover the chronic non-communicable epidemic.</p>
<p>Building further on the position expressed at the UN Summit on Non-communicable Diseases and the well-received European Respiratory Roadmap, ERS hopes for a constructive outcome to the Reflection Process, leading to a higher priority for chronic respiratory diseases and concrete action from the Commission and Member States.</p>

The impact of cigarette packaging: a World No Tobacco Day panel;the-impact-of-cigarette-packaging-a-world-no-tobacco-day-panel;"<p id=""article-title""><strong><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">ERS President Prof. Nikos Siafakas stressed need for ‘no tobacco’ awareness campaign.</span></strong></p>
<p id=""article"">
<p class=""lead""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">World No Tobacco Day 2010 saw a special panel session take place in the EU Parliament on the merits of standardised packaging and pictorial warnings for tobacco products.</span></p>
";"<span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Panellists focused on the impact of tobacco branding on consumers, especially vulnerable consumers such as teenagers.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id=""article"">
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">They refuted the tobacco industry’s claims over the ineffectiveness of standardised packaging, protection of intellectual property rights and counterfeitin0g. The panel, 31 May, brought together a group of seven distinguished panellists, with moderator, Jean King from Cancer Research UK It was held within the context of a one-day conference, hosted by MEPs Frieda Brepoels (Belgium), Ryszard Czarnecki (Poland) and Linda McAvan (UK). The conference and panel were organised by the Smoke Free Partnership, an advocacy group partially funded by ERS. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">In his conference address ERS President Prof. Nikos Siafakas, stressed the need for the ‘no tobacco’ awareness campaign. He highlighted the overall burden of respiratory disease and the effects of smoking on lung health.</span></p>
<p style=""float: right; padding: 15px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 15px; border: 3px solid #eeeeee;""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""><img src=""http://dev.ersnet.org/erw/images/smoke.jpg"" /></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">ERS considers tobacco use a major cause of respiratory ill health and premature death and denies membership to anyone involved in the tobacco industry in the ten years preceding their membership application. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Panellists were: Fiona Godfrey, Regional and Legal Advisor, Europe—International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease; Prof. Gerard Hastings, Director—Institute for Social Marketing (UK); Luk Joossens, Advocacy Officer—Association of European Cancer Leagues; Dr. Karin Gallopel Morvan, Associate Professor in Social Marketing—Graduate School of Business Administration, University of Rennes 1; and Florence Berteletti Kemp, Director—Smoke Free Partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Two other panellists were principally concerned over tobacco use among young people: Natasha Toropova, Advocacy Coordinator in Ukraine—Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and 15 year-old youth advocate Nicola McFadyen who is spearheading the UK campaign W-West, Why Waste Everything Smoking Tobacco. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""><b>Burden of proof</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Panellists refuted tobacco industry claims over lack of evidence that plain packaging will reduce cigarette smoking. The enormous damage to public health caused by tobacco use, stressed Rob Cunningham justified a ‘lower evidentiary burden’.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">“Policy makers have often supported or advocated laws where the level of ""proof"" was equal to or less than the existing evidence,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Mr. Cunningham added that, given graphic advertising’s purpose to increase sales, a strong argument exists that the onus of proof should fall on the opponents of plain packaging.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">&nbsp;Panellists noted that packaging is a key tobacco industry marketing tool, especially in countries where advertising is banned. </span></p>
<p style=""float: right; padding: 15px; width: 210px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 15px; border: 3px solid #eeeeee;""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""><i>“We view generic packaging as the biggest regulatory threat to the industry, as packaging is the most important way tobacco companies have to communicate with the consumer and differentiate their products.”</i> </span><br />
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""><b>Reaction of tobacco industry to new measures in Australia</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Commenting the tobacco industry’s fierce resistance to combined pictorial warning and standardized packaging, panellists cited its hostile response to new measures in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">They further refuted tobacco industry claims over packaging and intellectual property rights. They stressed that the use of a trademark is a privilege, not a right and can be regulated where deemed necessary to protect public health. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Luk Joossens noted that mandatory pictorial warnings were often country specific and would actually make counterfeiting and smuggling more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">In his view, it would be a massive success in the history of tobacco control at EU and global level to achieve, within four years, mandatory pictorial warnings at the back and front of the pack combined with standardised packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""><b>Message and user</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">However, tobacco is, above all, a consumer issue. Will smokers simply bypass unpleasant pictorial messages by, for example, transferring contents from packs to cigarette cases?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">For Gerard Hastings, even if this were the case, the messages would still serve a purpose, for example, by reducing the impact of sponsorship and shelf displays as well as communicating an important educational message. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">As for the young, is it possible that plain packaging would have the reverse effect and actually encourage rebellious youth to smoke? Not for Karine Gallopel who pointed out that “tens of thousands of teenagers ... have done exactly what countless pro-smoking advertisements suggest they do.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">She added that research shows that young people perceive plain packs as less ‘cool’ than branded packs but are more likely to take health warnings on plain packs more seriously. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Youth advocate Nicola McFadyen said that branding is very important to young people and that the tobacco companies have said that packaging is branding. The “narrow packs with pretty colours”, she said, clearly targeted teenage girls and the “packs with the fancy methods of opening” are meant to appeal to teenage boys.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">According to Natalia Toropova, campaigning for ‘tobacco-free kids’ in the Ukraine, a law adopted in 2009 calls for pictorial warnings to be introduced on cigarette packs as of 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">However, she pointed out that some labels in the EU set are not as effective as others, making it easy for countries to pick the least effective ones. An EU decision to introduce stronger pictorial warnings would have a positive effect on Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Moreover, if the EU were to establish plain packaging, this would set an extraordinary standard for countries to follow, concluded Ms. Toropova. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">*W-West an online resource in the UK that engages young people and informs them about smoking. It is funded by the Greater Glasgow and Clyde branch of Britain’s National Health Service. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">**Belgium, France, Latvia, Malta, Romania and UK.

New evidence published in support of ERS 10 Principles for Clean Air;new-evidence-published-in-support-of-ers-10-principles-for-clean-air;"<p>Two articles published this week in the Lancet and the Lancet Oncology show that the harmful effects of air pollution on health can occur even at low levels of pollution and reach beyond the respiratory system.</p>
";"
<p>In the Lancet Oncology, findings on air pollution and lung cancer incidence in 17 European cohorts show that <strong>long-term exposure to even low levels of air pollution increases risk of lung cancer</strong>. Using data from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), http://www.escapeproject.eu/ coordinated at the University of Utrecht, the investigators carried out a meta-analysis of 17 cohort studies in nine European countries including almost 313,000 people. Air pollution concentration was estimated at the home addresses using land-use regression models. Participants were tracked for new lung cancer diagnoses in national and local cancer registries, and the researchers applied statistical modelling to separate the influence of air pollutants from other factors like smoking, diet, and occupation.</p>

<p>In addition the Lancet published findings showing that s<strong>hort-term exposure to most major air pollutants raises the risk of hospitalisation for and death from heart failure.</strong></p>
<p><br />Short-term exposure to most major air pollutants appears to increase the risk of being hospitalised for and dying from heart failure, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 12 countries. The researchers estimate that a modest reduction in levels of just one major pollutant (3.9 µg/m3 of fine particulate matter found in exhaust fumes and industrial air pollutants) could prevent roughly 8000 heart failure hospitalisations and save more than US$300 million every year in the USA alone. The findings combined data from 35 studies assessing the impact of daily increases in gaseous air pollutants (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone) and particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) or less, or 10 micrometers (PM10) or less, on the risk of hospitalisations or death due to heart failure.</p>
<p>Commenting on the study, ERS Environment and Health Committee member Francesco Forastiere and Nera Agabiti from Lazio Regional Health Service in Rome, Italy welcomed the timing of the report since 2013 has been declared the Year of Air by the European Union (EU). ""The current EU limit for fine particulate matter is 25 μg/m³ (annual average, which is higher than the 10 μg/m³ set by WHO); however, the adverse health effects of air pollution are present even at concentrations well below this limit. The European Respiratory Society's Ten Principles for Clean Air state that citizens are entitled to clean air, just like clean water and safe food. These principles should be pursued by all necessary means, especially within the context of EU legislation.""</p>

New challenges in healthcare;new-challenges-in-healthcare;"<p><i>Part 2 of the ERS report on two days of reflection on chronic disease: Full report of the ERS ministerial conference, 19 October, Brussels – click on names to view presentations</i></p>
";"
<p>The ERS pre-ministerial conference ‘Chronic Respiratory Diseases – Exploring solutions in the EU’, part of a two day reflection on health policy and chronic disease, was launched 19 October with a welcome from ERS President <a target=""_blank"" href=""images/stories/New_Challenges_story/1._MDecramer-Intro_Read-Only_Compatibility_Mode.pdf"">Marc Decramer</a> followed by a brief word from the Belgian EU presidency on its rationale for placing chronic disease on the EU political agenda. Behind the discussions were the new challenges posed to healthcare systems.</p>

</div>
<p>ERS was one of two organisations invited to organise a pre-ministerial event due to their “commitment to raising awareness of chronic disease and empowering the patient”. This commitment was illustrated by the next speaker Ms. <a target=""_blank"" href=""images/stories/New_Challenges_story/2.%20Opening_Living%20with%20CRD_DHamerlijnck.pdf"">Dominique Hamerlijnck</a> (Netherlands) whose presentation ‘Living with chronic respiratory disease – a patient perspective’ spoke of the impact of chronic respiratory disease through the different stages in the patient’s life.</p>
<p>Her remarks were echoed by conference Chairman and and a former UK health minister and Member of the European Parliament, John Bowis, who pointed out that “Nobody who hasn’t experienced a disease understands fully what it feels like to have a disease.”</p>
<p>He praised the Belgian presidency for its chronic disease initiative, adding that the day’s proceedings would shed new light and lead to action on prevention, innovative care, patient empowerment and good practice.</p>
<h3><b>The experts</b></h3>

</ul>
<p>The first series of presentations analysed respiratory health issues at various points in life, from early childhood to the later years. Andy Bush pointed out that damage to the vulnerable lungs of young children, especially under the age of four will translate in later life to chronic respiratory disease.</p>
<p>Smoking, even air pollution, has an impact on the lungs of the unborn child, while excessive weight gain in the early years can also have negative impacts. “If you start out with poor lung function,” he said, “it will never get better”, adding that a bad start is equivalent to heavy smoking in later life.</p>
<p>Kai-Håkon Carlsen focused on the benefits of physical activity on the lung function of young people. He pointed to improved life prospects for children with serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis due to improved treatment and physical training</p>
<p>Prof. Carlsen cautioned on the negative impact of excessive training emphasising nonetheless that “If you don’t set aside time for physical activity when you are young, you will regret it later in life.”</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p>Klaus Rabe highlighted the upward curve of respiratory disease compared to other diseases, noting that chronic respiratory illness is associated with increased age, irrespective of risk factors.“The price of ageing is to understand that it will increase the incidence of degenerative chronic diseases,” he said.</p>
<p>During his presentation on adult respiratory disorders, he urged policy makers to take into account societal developments such as population migrations, which are already having an impact on the incidence of drug resistant tuberculosis. He added that policy needs to focus on reducing inequalities in healthcare in Europe.</p>
<p>Marc Decramer turned his attention to the issue of chronic respiratory disease late in life, highlighting, for example, the sharp rise in deaths due to COPD compared to other diseases, and deploring the lack of funding for research. In addition, the incidence of COPD is frequently underestimated because many cases remain undiagnosed.</p>
<p>He stressed the need to switch to more innovative models of patient care, for example self-management, tele-monitoring, tele-consulting and rehabilitation, with a focus on integrated care to take account of co-morbidities in chronic disease.</p>
<h3>The patient perspective</h3>

<li><span style=""font-size: 8pt;"">Ms. <a target=""_blank"" href=""images/stories/New_Challenges_story/6._L._Buzermaniene_PatientEmpowerment.pdf"">Lina Buzermaniene</a>, board member of the European Federation of Allergy and Airway Diseases Patients Association (EFA) and President, of the Lithuanian Council of Asthma Clubs: Patient empowerment in prevention and care of chronic respiratory disease.</span></li>

</ul>
<p>The expert session was immediately followed by two presentations dedicated to the patient perspective. Lina Buzermaniene stressed the potential of a partnership between health professional and ‘educated’ patient to improve disease management, outcomes and reduce costs. Active involvement will move the respiratory disease patient from victim to active campaigner for the freedom to breathe, she said.</p>
<p>Marianella Salapatas insisted on the need for a permanent liaison between patient and policy maker because health impacts on all key areas, from the economy to agriculture, from transport to regional development. She also highlighted COPD as a major public health issue and EFA’s June 2010 call for action at the European Parliament to make the disease a political priority.</p>
<p>Luke Clancy focused on tobacco not only as the most significant cause of chronic respiratory disease but itself as an addictive condition.: “I’m pretty sick of people saying it’s a habit; it’s a disease!” he exclaimed, adding that it is a disease that is under-researched and undertreated..</p>
<h3>From acute to chronic care</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 8pt;"">Dr. <a target=""_blank"" href=""images/stories/New_Challenges_story/9.%20P.%20Swennen_Innovative%20Models%20of%20CareDelivery.pdf"">Philippe Swennen</a>, International Association of Mutual Benefit Societies<b> </b>(AIM): Innovative models of healthcare delivery.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 8pt;""><a href=""http://www.franzhuainigg.at/"">Franz Josef Huainigg</a>, writer and Member of the Austrian Parliament.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Highlighting ‘Innovative models of care delivery', Dr. Philippe Swennen called for a paradigm shift in the organisation of the healthcare system from acute to chronic/long-term care, from fragmented to coordinated and integrated, from episodic to continuous, from hospital- to community-centred, from doctor dependent to team based, from reactive to preventive, from the patient as recipient to patient as partner, from infrequent to facilitated self-care and from the undervalued carer to the carer supported as a healthcare partner.</p>
<p>Dr. Swennen’s remarks were well illustrated in the ensuing moving patient testimonial from Franz Josef Huainigg, confined to a wheelchair and breathing permanently through a portable ventilator, yet independent, living with his family and continuing his work. (See “<a target=""_blank"" href=""index.php?option=com_flexicontent&amp;view=items&amp;cid=50:news&amp;id=4176:i-want-just-three-things-to-live-to-be-at-home-with-my-family-to-work-&amp;Itemid=136"">I want just three things: to live; to be at home with my family; to work …</a>”)</p>
<h3><b>Two areas of concern</b></h3>
<p>The morning session of the pre-ministerial conference terminated with two breakout sessions on innovative concepts for chronic respiratory disease prevention, the results of which were reported immediately during a session moderated by Frank Apfel, Managing Director, World Health Communication Associates (WHCA).</p>
<p>The session ‘The importance of the environment for lung health (indoor and outdoor air)’ stressed the fundamental right to clean air and called for a second Environmental and Health Action Plan in the EU. The group outlined the need for specific policies aimed at improving air quality, for example using taxation to internalise the health costs of transport and related emissions and introducing tougher standards for air quality in workplace and school.</p>
<p>The other breakout session, ‘Physical activity, sleep, obesity and nutrition’, recommended investment in promoting healthy lifestyles and nutrition and that such information should be included in the school curriculum. The group members called for monitoring in areas of child and adolescent growth and highlighted the need to do more to raise awareness of sleep disorders. They recognised the problem inherent in perceiving smoking or obesity as lifestyle choices. Exercise should, they said, be viewed at one and the same time as prevention, maintenance and treatment.</p>

<p>The principal message of Dr. Hans Kluge was that, in the present climate of public spending cuts, it was important to safeguard budgets for education and to ensure a minimum package of health services. He noted that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends viewing the economic crisis as an opportunity to reform healthcare*.</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p>Dr. Ryś highlighted current EU actions in the field of prevention, notably lowering emissions and tobacco control measures, adding that the draft cross-border healthcare directive is set to make it easier for patients to access medical treatment abroad and is likely to foster cooperation between difference centres, raise quality and reduce healthcare costs.</p>
<p>Prof. Mika Mäkelä described how a low-budget project to treat asthma <i>via</i> a network of healthcare centres in small communities throughout Finland has resulted in early intervention on the disease, improved monitoring and a 70% decrease in hospitalisations. “Community disease needs community solutions,” he said.</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p>Ri de Ridder said Europe was looking for scope for innovation and to improve quality and accessibility of care. He said he hoped conference would make clear what added value Europe can bring to healthcare debate and policy.</p>
<p>Monika Kosinska called for political will to resolve inequalities of healthcare, adding that providers must devise cost effective approaches notably through sharing best practice; prevention must, however, remain the priority. Ms. Kosisnka welcomed the notion of eHealth but said it should be patient rather than industry driven.</p>
<p>Last speaker of the session, Yves Sibille, explained the rationale behind the ERS Respiratory Roadmap, which, he said, would focus on recommendations and actions to improve performance in prevention, clinical care, research and education.</p>
<p>In the ensuing debate, panellists noted that healthcare services had done a good job to date but that the paradigm now needs to change. For research, more effort should go into pinpointing what research should be prioritised. There was an emphasis on political will among ministers to ensure implementation of new approaches aimed at delivering effective care.</p>
<p>Where care models work, for example asthma care in Finland, panellists recommended they be used as examples of best practice in other countries and for other chronic diseases such as COPD. It was generally agreed that early diagnosis is the key and that the case should be made for general practitioners to implement spirometry in general practice.</p>
<p>According to the panel, generic approaches might be considered for respiratory diseases as a means of raising quality and cutting costs. Such approaches might be derived from evidence-based disease specific interventions.</p>
<p>Panellists declared themselves grateful to see respiratory health now in its rightful place high on the public health agenda. From now on, they concluded, everything is a gain.</p>

";"
<p>With the burden of this chronic non-communicable disease ever-increasing, the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD), of which the Commission is a member, has agreed to launch a call for proposals on the prevention and treatment of lung diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Controlling tobacco consumption and reducing harmful indoor and outdoor environmental exposures are among the most important interventions in lung disease.</p>
<p>Smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption are considered the single most important cause of preventable morbidity and premature mortality worldwide. Tobacco addiction causes about 5.4 million people death each year, and if resolute and urgent action is not taken by 2030 the epidemic will cause between 8 and 10 million deaths each year, of which over 80% occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Smoking is a major cause of inequality in health between gender, socioeconomic groups and age categories. With nicotine being highly addictive, it is important to prevent young people from taking up tobacco use. 70% of &nbsp;smokers start before the age of 18 and 94% before the age of 25 years.</p>
<p>The precise health risk that environment exposure poses to lung diseases is not well established because of the difficulty to assess the prevalence linked to the amount of exposure. Risk assessment is further complicated by socioeconomic, age and genetic factors.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>Proposals must</p>
<ul>
<li>have a focus on lung diseases and &nbsp;implementation science.</li>
<li>Address what works, for whom, under what contextual circumstances and are the intervention(s) adaptable and scalable in ways that are accessible and equitable.</li>
<li>Generate new knowledge on interventions and their implementation for the prevention and treatment of lung diseases in LMIC, and/or in vulnerable populations in HIC.</li>
<li>Focus on existing approaches to prevention and control of lung diseases or develop treatments at lower costs. They should demonstrate a sound understanding of the local health system context as well as the global cross-sectorial context.</li>

<p>The Final conclusions on 'Innovative approaches for chronic disease in public health and healthcare systems', adopted at the 7 December 2010 Council meeting in Brussels integrated ERS recommendations on:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li> Integrated patient-centred approaches for health promotion, primary prevention, secondary prevention, treatment and care of chronic disease;</li>
<li>Improved early detection / diagnosis/ cost-effective screening;</li>
<li>The potential of e-health / technologies etc. for active and healthy ageing;</li>
<li>Health inequalities (e.g. re low socioeconomic groups)</li>
<li>Involving relevant stakeholders in the ""reflection process"" to optimize the response to challenges of chronic diseases;</li>
<li>Implementation of innovative chronic care models in primary and community healthcare;</li>
<li>The need for comparable data at European level on incidence, prevalence, risk factors and outcomes;</li>
<li>Make research into chronic disease a priority (in current and future European research and action programmes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Commented ERS President Prof. Marc Decramer: ""The ERS recommendations were the result of a high degree of consensus among all stakeholders and I'm delighted to see that the Council has taken them on board.</p>
<p>""This, however, is only the beginning of a process that should culminate in concrete policy and actions,"" he added.</p>
<p>The recommendations were formulated during the course of the ERS pre-ministerial conference held in Brussels on 19 October, which assembled numerous organisations and their representatives, notably patient associations.</p>
<p>President Decramer reported the recommendations to a full ministerial meeting, also in Brussels, the following day.</p>";22.12.2010 13:33;o:ce780883918ebe8c7031

Respiratory Summit provides more perspective on priorities;respiratory-summit-provides-more-perspective-on-priorities;"<p><img style=""margin-left: 10px; float: right;"" alt=""Reilly_WS"" src=""images/stories/weekly/Reilly_WS.jpg"" height=""170"" width=""281"" />4 and 5 March, the historic university city of Leuven, Belgium, provided the backdrop to the wide-reaching commentary, analysis and debate that comprised the ERS Summit on Priorities in Respiratory Medicine. The aim, noted ERS President Marc Decramer in his brief opening remarks, was to place more perspective on the issue through insights from</p>
";"
<p>experts external to ERS on Day 1, while Day 2 would be devoted to points of view expressed by experts from within the Society.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Day 1 proved to be a highly focused session, beginning with a report from a project to map, in terms of influence and impact, the different branches of respiratory medicine in relation to each other, as well as respiratory medicine in relation to other selected medical sectors. It culminated with an outline of the dramatically evolving healthcare environment of economic realpolitik and medical ethics. In between, expert speakers investigated policy and developments in the 'four pillars' of ERS, i.e. research, clinical care, education, and prevention.</p>
<p>Perspectives outlined during research session, chaired by ERS Scientific Chair Laurent Nicod, included the broad details of INNOVATION UNION, the latest EU blueprint for research, followed by an outline of the strategic plan, established in 2007, for medical research in the United States. The session culminated with a description of the evolving perspective on research and development within the pharmaceutical industry and models of collaboration.</p>
<p>The clinical medicine session, chaired by Marc Decramer, provided a statistical and analytical overview of the burden of respiratory disease worldwide, an economics perspective on the various models for social and healthcare spending as well as the healthcare policy options based on two national case studies, Belgium and the UK.</p>
<p>School Chair Paolo Palange hosted the session on priorities in medical education and training, where emphasis was placed on a good grounding in knowledge and understanding, the ability to team work and producing doctors rather than academics. The session also focused on harmonised medical training and current and potential models for and national/European conformity assessment and accreditation.</p>
<p>The final session of Day 1, chaired by Yves Sibille, ERS Secretary for EU Affairs, highlighted the role of patients and the media in healthcare advocacy, notably in messages of prevention. It further provided a blueprint for effective lobbying and the new model of advocacy coalitions. The day's proceedings concluded with an outline of ethical considerations, notably health inequities, access to healthcare and end of life/palliative care.</p>
<p>Summit Day 2 comprised four breakout sessions, with ERS experts covering the same domains as the previous day, i.e. research, clinical medicine, education and training and advocacy. The debate and conclusions, reported at the subsequent plenary, will complement or amend parts of the just-published European Respiratory Roadmap, the first version of which was made available to the more than 130 Summit participants.</p>
<p>A definitive version is now in preparation and will be published in advance of the ERS Annual Congress in Amsterdam. A shorter version will be developed as a proposed action plan on respiratory medicine aimed specifically at policymakers.</p>
<p>This brief outline of the ERS Summit will be supplemented by a fuller report to appear in the next edition of the ER Weekly. However, the official report will be published in a future edition of the European Respiratory Journal.</p>

<p>What are the priorities in respiratory medicine for the next decade? This was the essential question the ERS Respiratory Summit was called upon to answer, from the point of view of research, clinical medicine, and medical education and training.</p>
";"
<p>A further session was devoted to way and means of translating recommendations and action plans from those three fields into effective respiratory healthcare advocacy involving key stakeholders and lobbying tactics for specific campaigns. The spotlight was also focused on prevention and related messages and sctivities.</p>

<p>ERS President Marc Decramer announced the Summit as one of milestones of his presidency during an inaugural address at the ERS Annual Congress in Barcelona, where he outlined his twin priorities for his presidency 2010-11: to re-affirm the priority of respiratory health with decision makers and to translate plans into action with a respiratory roadmap for the coming decade.</p>
<p>The role of the ERS Respiratory Summi, organised by Prof. Decramer together with Prof. Ben Nemery, was to put the final touches to the 2020 European Respiratory Roadmap, the first version of which was distributed to Summit attendees. This already comprehensive document—with key input from the ERS Assemblies, the ERS Scientific and School Chairs, the European Lung Foundation as well as from the ERS groups involved in Tobacco Control and Environmental and Occupational Respiratory issues—would be complemented and amended as a result of the two day Leuven event.</p>

<p>The first day of the Summit opened with preliminary results of a bibliometric analysis by Prof. Ed Noyons, which provided numerous insights into its specificities, in particular its self-sufficiency and the fact that letters play an important role in the content of respiratory publications.</p>
<p>Prof. Noyons pointed out that the study did not go into quality issues, although he made the observation that 'impact factor' in itself refers only to a publication's citations and has little bearing on quality. He pondered whether a key performance indicator might equally be societal impact. He added that observations, conclusions and perspectives derived from the study might subsequently be used in ERS strategic analysis and planning.</p>
<p>The first session proposed three perspectives on research, one from 'Europe', one from the United States and one from the pharmaceutical industry. Speaking on behalf of the European Commissioner for Research and Innovation, Ms. Patricia Reilly highlighted the need to facilitate research and innovation by cutting red tape as well as streamlining and simplifying the process of obtaining EU grants. She pointed to a public consultative Green Paper on a common strategic framework for research and science to ensure a sustainable and competitive European science basis. ""We accept that the procedures are overly burdensome,"" said Ms Reilly, adding that ""ERS has been instrumental in advising the Commission in this area"".</p>
<p>She illustrated the need to fill the the existing gap in addressing interdisciplinarity in biomedical research in particular with a view to comorbidities, and highlighted the integrated approach of the EU pilot project on 'Active and Healthy Ageing', a flagship initiative of 'INNOVATION UNION', and part of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In relation to the societal challenges—for example, by 2020 healthcare expenditure will be an estimated 16% of EU GDP; the decreasing investment in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, when the estimated cost is €1 billion to bring one drug to market—the way forward, said Ms Reilly, would be to develop innovation partnerships ""to make the best use of what we have"". In her closing remarks, she offered a few words of advice on the future direction for EU funding. ""There must,"" she said, ""be better inter-disease coordination as well as, among other disciplines such as ICT, an EU-added value, something that national governments cannot do.""</p>
<p>An American perspective on pulmonary research priorities was provided by James Kiley, who outlined the strategic plan of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), released a strategic plan in 2007 to guide research and training programs in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of heart, lung and blood diseases. Its three goals consist of 1/ improving the understanding of the molecular and physiologic basis of health and disease; 2/ developing personalized preventive and therapeutic regimens; 3/ improving the translation of research findings into practice.</p>
<p>With regard to pulmonary disease, NHLBI priorities in the field of the molecular characterization of disease are to detect pathobiology before disease, to define imprints of exposure (including the microbiome of the airways), to integrate multi-scale measurements of lung disease phenotypes (including by the use of new imaging techniques), to redefine disease at molecular level. Another priority lies in the field of lung regeneration. In the field of prevention, priorities are to define susceptibility factors, early detection of abnormalities, testing of preventive interventions, and attention for the pediatric origins of adult disease. Further priorities are to develop novel interventions (effective targeted therapies without side effects, personal medicine and optimised multimodal therapies) and to understand integrative mechanisms in multi-organ diseases involving the lung (including sleep disorders)..</p>
<p>Insights into biomedical research priorities from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry came from Tim Higenbottam, Director of Corporate Clinical Development at Chiesi Farmaceutici. He pointed out that in the past 20 years, only very few new drug therapies have been developed by the pharmaceutical industry; thus leading to a period of considerable reduction in its R&amp;D spending (21% from 2000 to 2009). These cuts have mainly taken place in Major Pharma, which have not been efficient and had the mistaken belief that fundamental biological research can be done within the confines of single companies.</p>
<p>In contrast, noted Mr. Higenbottam, Mid Pharma (companies having a total sale of around a billion Euros) has continued to thrive thanks to externalisation of non-core tasks and collaboration with academic centres, often with a focus on specific diseases. He also stressed the need for the patient's perspective on research activity. ""No disease can be treated if we do not have the patient's point of view ... meeting unmet needs is based on the unmet needs of the patient.""</p>
<p>Opening the session on priorities in clinical medicine, Hans Kluge suggested going beyond the risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases (NCD) and looking at the social and economic determinants. He highlighted the current focus on acute care for NCDs rather than on prevention, despite the fact that risk factors are well known, notably alcohol, tobacco and poor nutrition. He outlined the target agenda for prevention methods, cautioning ""We have to step forward and look at innovative ways—otherwise we are going to lose the battle"".</p>
<p>Focusing on the burden of disease in Europe, Karl Freese posited the problem of addressing a large number of diseases with a common range of policies. He commended the ERS for providing such an interesting programme of science and policy at the Pre-ministerial Conference on Chronic Respiratory Diseases held in Brussels on 19 October 2010. The European Commission emphasised that, at EU level, a strategy for chronic diseases is likely to be acceptable, but that a disease-specific strategy for respiratory alone would not be realistic. Mr. Freese further noted that Europe's average life expectancy of 80 years (slightly lower for men, slightly higher for women) included an average of 62 healthy years, that is, before the onset of chronic disease.</p>
<p>Following an analysis of the economic performance of a number of countries, economist Paul de Grauwe, concluded that globalisation would not inevitably lead to a 'rush to the bottom' in terms of health and social spending. He demonstrated that Scandinavian countries are in the top league of world competitiveness yet remain the world's biggest spenders on social and health programmes. He attributed this to their 'easy' relationship with globalisation and posited the long-term sustainability of the intelligently designed Scandinavian model.</p>
<p>Former Belgian Minister of Social Affairs Frank Vandenbroucke emphasised the surprisingly high willingness of citizens to pay for healthy life years, with resulting impact on future budget spending on health care. In his view, inequities in access and inequality in health status would mostly likely increase in the future. He further said that there will be a shift from hospital based care to long-term chronic care. This in turn would lead to a major problem with regard to the work force; more ""hands-on"" staff and carers will be needed in future.</p>
<p>Mr. Vandenbroucke alluded to the organisational consequences of an increasing focus on chronic disease prevention and treatment, noting, for example, that more emphasis will be needed on the process and compliance than on products; and on care coordination pathways such as disease management programmes. He pointed out that there are efficiencies and inefficiencies in every system, noting that a legislated 4.5% annual growth in healthcare spending had proved to be too high. Studies show it should be only slightly above the percentage growth in GDP as that creates the necessary pressure for an optimal healthcare system.</p>
<p>Mr. Vandenbroucke further highlighted the impact of air pollution and smoking on respiratory health, noting that, in terms of prevention ""I'm not terribly proud of our performance as politicians"". He said that approaches had frequently been too timid in areas, such as tobacco control legislation, where it had been clearly demonstrated, that, where government leads, public opinion will follow.</p>
<p>Representing the UK Department of Health, Kevin Holton and Sue Hill provided a national perspective on the future of healthcare. Mr. Holton pointed out that only a small fraction of patients were compliant with care, that only 30% of those diagnosed receive optimised treatment and that there was a 30% misdiagnosis rate. Noting that personal care planning was good at raising awareness but bad at motivating people to change behaviour, he envisaged a multifaceted approach to long-term care conditions.</p>
<p>For COPD care in the UK, Sue Hill stressed the importance of being clear in the message you want to get across and what you want to achieve, for example, that a reduction in smoking now will not substantially reduce problems related to COPD in the immediate and medium term future. Strategy should be proactive, with a focus on outcomes and early and accurate diagnosis and the importance of knowing when the approach should be generalist, when specialist. She highlighted the need for accurate information for patients as well as better interaction between healthcare specialists and patients with due regard to appropriate messages. Rather than a focus on a single acronym that is not widely understood, <em>i.e</em>. COPD, strategies should focus on lung disease awareness and early diagnosis, stressed Ms. Hill.</p>
<p>Opening the session on challenges in medical education and training, Prof. Jim McKillop defined the 4 'Ps' of medicine as predictive, personalised, pre-emptive and participatory, emphasising the need for the practitioner to be confident, competent, to show empathy, humanity, and honesty, willing to view the patient as an important partner, respecting the patient's wishes and helping him/her cope with the consequences. ""We have to give medical students good grounding in knowledge and understanding,"" he said.</p>
<p>Prof. McKillop stressed the importance of discouraging students from trying to recall procedures rather than look them up, the need to inculcate skills and the need to know ""what you can do and what you need to improve"". He said that team working means understanding not only leadership but also followship.</p>
<p>In his presentation, Prof. Robin Stevenson highlighted the role of the HERMES in European harmonisation, through its project or training centre accreditation, as well as its syllabus and curriculum for respiratory training and examination now used in certain countries for national certification of knowledge acquisition and application.</p>
<p>He said CME providers must deliver material in a format, preferably interactive, conducive to learning and resulting in changes in clinical practice. He favoured the current CME accreditation system in place in North America, based on provider accreditation and incentives over that in Europe, which accredits educational activities, adding, nonetheless, that proposals to subordinate national authority to a European agency would run into subsidiarity principle. ""Harmonisation of European CME accreditation is perhaps the most difficult challenge of the next decade,"" he concluded.</p>
<p>In opening the final session of the day, Health advocacy in the coming decade, Michael Rutgers of Astma Fonds, noted a major paradigm shift from what he called ""patient manipulation"" to patients helping design the service. He noted their increased involvement in helping set the research agenda as well as contribution to the implementation of its results.</p>
<p>He put this down to their expertise in living with chronic disease and the growing requirement for personalised care. Speaking on behalf of patients, Dr Rutgers concluded: ""We'd like to help - and we can help,"" adding, ""Advocacy without patients doesn't go anywhere.""</p>
<p>Medical Science journalist Jacques Poncin illustrated the essential role of the media as a vehicle of specific messages, notably in the early and mid-stages of the AIDS pandemic where, in the absence of any credible treatment, the focus was on methods of prevention. He said the media had a vital role to play, notably in developing culturally specific messages to target groups at risk. He added, however, that specific targeting is difficult, for example in the case of tobacco.</p>
<p>Mr. Poncin noted the tendency of news media in issues of public health to favour the newsworthy—<em>e.g.</em> mad cow disease— over messages of strict public interest, for example, seasonal 'flu, but advised, nevertheless, that it was essential to have a presence in all of today's media, both traditional and contemporary.</p>
<p>ERS Executive Director Archie Turnbull stressed the need for effective lobbying to achieve the respiratory research, healthcare, education and training goals identified during the summit in the face of diminishing budgets and increased competition from other fields. He outlined a blueprint for advocacy, noting along the way the need to find common goals with the competition and move towards alliance building strategies, that is becoming increasingly necessary to achieve common and broader goals. ""We have a lot to do to remain relevant, but if we don't, we won't be,"" commented Mr. Turnbull.</p>
<p>Closing the day's proceedings, Prof. Anne Slowther highlighted, in particular, tackling health inequalities, and welcomed the fact that ERS in its 19 October conference recommendations to the EU Council stressed this point. To illustrate the former, she cited, in the UK, differing hospital admission rates for acute asthma according to ethnicity and, in western countries, greater prevalence of tuberculosis among immigrant populations.</p>
<p>As a second ethical challenge, Prof. Slowther cited palliative care for end-of-life respiratory patients, which is far behind that of cancer patients, and further stressed the interdisciplinary challenge in the need for palliative care physicians to work together with respiratory specialists. She emphasised the necessity of research to identify appropriate models of care for people dying from respiratory disease and the challenge for clinicians in helping make decisions about end of life care for people who cannot decide for themselves.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""><strong>Brussels, Belgium [16 June 2011]</strong>: The European Parliament saw leading respiratory organisations and policy makers unite this week to present and discuss the need for a comprehensive strategy to combat the growing epidemic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants from across Europe, including representatives from national professional organisations, patient associations and physicians, attended the open forum meeting, hosted by Catherine Stihler, Member of the European Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Catherine Stihler, a leading advocate within the European Parliament on COPD and Chairman of the open forum event commented: ""With the relevance of COPD underestimated, amidst differing standards affecting patient care, a joint effort is needed to address this burdensome disease for patients and their families. Across national and European levels, limitations in policies need to be challenged and obstacles to effective care need to be removed. What we need is a robust policy framework to allow healthcare professionals to identify patients earlier and make the necessary interventions to tackle this disease effectively.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">COPD affects nearly 44 million people in Europe1 and is predicted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 20302. In spite of these alarming figures, significant discrepancies exist across Europe in the understanding of the scope and impact of the disease, its diagnosis and effective management of the condition. COPD costs almost 50 billion Euros annually3 and accounts for approximately 41.3 percent of all lost working days every year in Europe3. Estimating the overall cost of COPD needs to account for both direct costs (such as treatment and hospital costs) and indirect costs (such as loss of work days and disability) to fully understand the implications for healthcare systems and national economies.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">""To address the escalating socio-economic burden of COPD, we need a clear and implementable strategy across Europe. The European Respiratory Society and the European Lung Foundation, in cooperation with European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients' Associations, are working in partnership to improve education about COPD.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">""By ensuring the latest research is accessible to a wide audience, we can help make COPD a health priority across Europe,"" stated Marc Decramer, President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Despite COPD being a preventable and treatable disease, studies have shown that as many as 75 percent of those affected remain undiagnosed4. Marianella Salapatas, President of the European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients' Associations (EFA) explains: ""Smoking is a major risk factor of COPD. People who experience symptoms therefore often feel stigmatised and thus often do not seek advice from a healthcare professional until the disease is already in an advanced stage.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">""By implementing effective treatment management protocols such as smoking cessation and a stepwise approach to treatment, as recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, disease progression may be delayed,"" emphasised Monica Fletcher, Chair of the European Lung Foundation (ELF).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">Discussing the management of COPD, Dr. David Halpin, Consultant Physician and Senior Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine, Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, UK said: ""Best outcomes can be achieved with a holistic treatment approach, which includes smoking cessation. I am very confident that collaborative initiatives such as this one today by ERS, ELF, and EFA will help to put COPD higher on the agenda of European decision-makers and thus help to reduce the number of deaths and the significant economic burden caused by this disease.""</span></p>

ERS join UN debate on non-communicable diseases;ers-join-un-debate-on-non-communicable-diseases;"<p>Representatives from the ERS joined a global debate at the UN Headquarters last week (16 June 2011) to address the impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which account for nearly two thirds of deaths worldwide each year.</p>
<p>Academics, public health experts and health activists, joined together for the hearing which is a precursor for the first-ever high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of these diseases, which will begin in New York on 19 September 2011.</p>
";"
<p>According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), 36.1 million people died in 2008 from conditions such as heart disease, strokes, chronic lung diseases, cancers and diabetes. Nearly 80 per cent of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Joseph Deiss, President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, said: ""No one actor is able to harness the resources necessary or address the complex range of factors that are driving the progression of these diseases. An important challenge that the global community faces is how to build partnerships and respond effectively at a time of financial constraint and at a time when there is still much work to do on other global health issues.""</p>
<p>Prof Francesco Blasi, Vice-President of the ERS, said: ""We welcomed the opportunity to feed into this discussion on non-communicable diseases. Chronic respiratory diseases will be the diseases of the future. They are not only highly prevalent chronic diseases, but their prevalence is also increasing. Our input into the meeting included 20 specific and achievable outcomes, which we believe will help tackle the non-communicable burden. We must work together and pool resources to address this growing crisis.""</p>

Evidence shows that the larger the warnings, the more effective they are in reducing the attractiveness of tobacco products to children and young people. Therefore, it is important to define a minimum size of the warnings that guarantees the visibility.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;"">Regarding traceability and security features of the tobacco products packages, ERS welcomes the ENVI Committee’s decision to adopt unique identifiers that contribute to a tracking and tracing system combating contraband of legitimate products and also, to adopt security features composed of visible and invisible parts which help in the identification of counterfeit products. Furthermore, the provisions reinforcing the independence of the tracking and tracing system and the data storage facilities form the tobacco industry are welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;"">In addition, the ENVI Committee decided to regulate nicotine containing products / electronic cigarettes as medicinal products.</span></p>

<p>No, we are not talking about banks – although this would probably, and sadly, be more likely to catch your attention. We are talking about the cataclysmic effects of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on people's health and lives but also the global economy. And the need for the UN High-Level Meeting on 19/20 September on NCDs to be a resounding success. NCDs include heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer diseases, and chronic respiratory, kidney and liver diseases.</p>

ERS welcomes the Council of Ministers conclusions on chronic respiratory diseases;ers-welcomes-the-council-of-ministers-conclusions-on-chronic-respiratory-diseases;"<img style=""margin-right: 10px; float: left;"" src=""images/stories/Consilium_logo_RS_WS.jpg"" />The ERS welcomes the decision of European Council of Ministers taken on the 2 December to adopt Council conclusions on chronic respiratory diseases in children. This is a major political step and ERS will be working hard to see these Council conclusions implemented across Europe.
<p>Chronic respiratory diseases are recognised to be the most common non-communicable diseases in children, and they have been on the rise in recent decades. That is why following on from the ERS conference with the Belgian Presidency of the EU and the production of the European Respiratory Roadmap the Polish Presidency has made respiratory disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment a priority for public health.</p>
";"
<p>In its conclusions, the Council invites member states to tackle the problems which constitute the biggest risk factors that could trigger a chronic respiratory disease: tobacco smoke, poor indoor air quality and outdoor air pollution.</p>
<p>Prevention should begin before childbirth, and stop-smoking programmes for pregnant women should, for instance, be intensified. In addition, future mothers and children should be protected against exposure to tobacco smoke, in particular at home and in closed spaces.</p>
<p>The Council conclusions state furthermore that knowledge and public awareness play a key role in the prevention and treatment of these diseases and should be increased. Health education of children, parents and teachers is recognised as important in this regard, as well as training of health professionals.</p>
<p>Cooperation and exchange of best practices are also emphasised, and the European Commission is invited to support member states in implementing their policies and improving networking, in particular international research networks. ERS aims to be at the forefront of improving the networking and exchange of best practice in this area.</p>

ERS calls on EU to adopt plain packaging of tobacco products to discourage young smokers;ers-calls-on-eu-to-adopt-plain-packaging-of-tobacco-products-to-discourage-young-smokers;"<em><strong>29 February 2012, Brussels</strong></em> – Plain packaging of tobacco products should be introduced in Europe to reduce the appeal of smoking among adolescents, according to the ERS, and other health based organisations.
";"
<p>Cigarette packaging with plain fonts, no logos and large and explicit picture and text messages will further de-normalise and de-glamorise smoking. Promotional branding continues to drive teen smoking; a cigarette pack can become a 'badge' in the same way as trainers and mobile phones do, according to the Belgian Foundation against Cancer, the French league against Cancer and the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.smokefreepartnership.eu/"">Smoke Free Partnership</a> of which ERS is a member. These organisations held a conference in the European Parliament on the 29<sup>th</sup> of February.<a href=""#1""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>""Introducing plain packaging would deter smoking thus contributing to the prevention of all four of today's major killers: cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes,"" says Prof Marc Decramer, immediate ERS past president who attending the high level event in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>He adds: ""Health experts everywhere recognise this policy development as one of the most cost-effective public health measures available to governments today"".</p>
<p>International public health expert and social scientist, David Hammond from the University of Waterloo, Canada, says: ""The brand imagery, logos, and designs on cigarette packs serve as a critically important promotional tool, particularly for reaching priority groups such as young women and youth.""</p>
<p>""My research shows that plain packaging of cigarettes would reduce the attractiveness of smoking, particularly among young people. Plain packaging would also help to reduce false beliefs that some cigarette brands are less harmful than others.""<a href=""#2""><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Australia is the first country in the world to pass legislation on plain packaging<a href=""#3""><sup>3</sup></a> but there is a worldwide trend towards larger picture and text warnings. Some EU countries already have sizable pictorial warnings, and legislation in Uruguay requires images covering 80% of the front and back of cigarette packs.<a href=""#4""><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In Europe, the current challenge is to stop adolescents from becoming smokers, the organisers say. Europe has the highest rate of 13-15 year old smokers in the world<a href=""#5""><sup>5</sup></a> – and those who become regular long term smokers have a 1 in 2 risk of dying from a tobacco related disease<a href=""#6""><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>""Our top priority is large (80%) mandatory picture warnings at the front and back of all tobacco products (not only cigarette packs) in combination with standardised, plain packaging. We also stress the importance of adding quit lines on the pack of all tobacco products,"" says Florence Berteletti-Kemp of the Smoke Free Partnership.</p>
<p>The European Commission is currently considering a revision of the Tobacco Directive.  It has reported on its consultation, including comments on plain packaging.<a href=""#7""><sup>7</sup></a> Having signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control<a href=""#8""><sup>8</sup></a>, the European Union should be committed to introducing plain packaging. ""Plain packing is feasible, legal and easily implementable. It does not cost any money to governments and works for public health. There is no excuse not to do it,"" Ms Berteletti-Kemp adds.</p>

Experts call for cleaner air to tackle invisible killer;experts-call-for-cleaner-air-to-tackle-invisible-killer;"<h3>10 principles for clean air released ahead of review of air quality legislation</h3>
<p>Urgent action is needed to reduce the high concentrations of dangerous air pollutants in Europe, according to experts writing in the European Respiratory Journal today (1 March 2012).</p>
";"
<p>The European Respiratory Society's Environment and Health Committee are urging policymakers in Europe to introduce changes that will ensure the air that we breathe is safe and clean.</p>
<p>The call to action comes ahead of the upcoming review of air quality legislation in the European Union (EU) before the 2013 Year of Air. In the editorial, the ERS committee argues that any new legislation must strive to ultimately bring air pollution levels in Europe down to the already adopted World Health Organization (WHO) limits and international commitments made by EU leaders.</p>
<p>As guidance for public health policy, Prof. Dr. Bert Brunekreef, from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and colleagues have devised '10 principles for clean air.'  These principles include:</p>
<h4>The need to significantly reduce concentrations of fine particles and ozone – the most health-threatening of all air pollutants</h4>
<p>The current limit values for major air pollutants in Europe offer little protection from the damage that can be caused to a person's health. The limit values for particles far exceed the WHO advice and do not match the standards adopted by other countries.</p>
<h4>Reducing the damage caused by living close to or attending schools near busy roads</h4>
<p>Policy makers should consider enacting further legislation with the aim to reduce or eliminate ultrafine particle and other toxic emissions from motor vehicles. Ultrafine particles and black carbon should also be considered as possible indicators for further studies and research.</p>
<h4>The need for more awareness of high temperatures and air pollutants that act in synergy to produce more serious health effects than heat or pollution alone.</h4>
<p>Heat waves and high summer temperatures produce higher ozone concentrations which will lead to increased burden of disease and premature deaths, particularly in the elderly or patients with chronic respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>Enhance the key message that outdoor air pollution is one of the biggest environmental health threats in Europe today</p>
<p>An analysis carried out by the WHO estimated that current exposure to particulate matter leads to an average loss of 8.6 months of life expectancy in Europe.</p>
<p>Professor Brunekreef said: ""The upcoming review of EU air policies is an important opportunity for policy makers to take substantial steps needed to reduce the high concentrations of dangerous air pollutants such as fine particles and ozone. We hope that the European Respiratory Society's 10 principles for clean air will guide policy makers to take the right and necessary measures to strengthen current EU limit values and safeguard public health. Many benefits would be realised including increased life expectancy, increased productivity, and improved health for all.""</p>

";"
<p>While ERS welcomes the <b>targets</b> proposed they could however be <b>more numerous, more ambitious</b>, and reflect more broadly the political declaration.</p>
<p>Regarding <b>indicators</b>, ERS is concerned that despite the fact that lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in low and middle-income countries and the single most significant cause of cancer-related death - that there is <b>no reference in the WHO discussion paper to lung cancer</b>.</p>
<p>ERS also expressed concern that the WHO discussion paper makes <b>no reference to environmental exposures and their contribution to NCDs.</b></p>
<p>Ahead of the World Health Assembly, ERS urges Member States to build on the momentum of the Political declaration and announce at the Assembly in May a target to <b>reduce preventable deaths from NCDs by 25% by 2025</b> and recommit to realising in full the ambitions articulated in the Political Declaration.</p>
<p>ERS has been fully involved in this process since the High Level Meeting and remains committed to seeing the Political Declaration fully implemented in the EU.</p>

 ERS Tallinn summit highlights urgent need to bridge health gap;#NAME?;"<p><img style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right;"" alt=""tallinn_small_crop"" src=""images/stories/tallinn_small_crop.jpg"" height=""156"" width=""240"" />The European Respiratory Society (ERS) hosted a critical summit this weekend (8-9 June 2012) to discuss the growing problem of health inequalities in Europe.</p>
<p>The key event, which brought together leading experts from politics and health, created an opportunity to implement change and address the issue of health inequalities, which are becoming even more apparent during tough economic times.</p>
";"
<p>The aim of the summit, entitled ‘Bridging the Health Divide in Europe – exchanging experiences to reduce avoidable health inequalities and preventable respiratory diseases’, was to follow on from goals set out in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/88613/E91438.pdf"">Tallinn charter</a>. The event allowed healthcare stakeholders to exchange experiences on the best ways to deal with health inequalities.</p>
<p>The gap in healthcare is particularly prominent for respiratory diseases. Social inequality causes a higher proportion of deaths in respiratory disease than in any other diseases. It is associated with social inequalities in all age-groups, particularly in children and prevention of respiratory infections could make a major contribution to reducing health inequalities.</p>
<p>Delegates and speakers at the summit, which included Hanno Pevkur, the Estonian Minister of Social Affairs and Health and Dr Ingrida Circene, the Latvian Minister of Health, agreed that one of the ways to tackle health inequalities was to ensure that countries have a basic level of universal health coverage.</p>
<p>Another way governments could tackle the problem is to invest more in prevention and health promotion for vulnerable groups. It was pointed out by the experts at the Summit that even in crisis there were cost-effective measures that could be adopted that would make a real change to the rising inequality.</p>
<p>One measure that would cost governments nothing in these times of austerity but that would go far in preventing young people from taking up smoking would be plain packaging with large pictorial warnings on the health hazards associated with tobacco use.</p>
<p>Other experts attending the conference, including Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO Director for Public Health and Health Systems, pointed out that the most important people to bridge the widening health divide were the finance ministers.</p>
<p>The session included five breakout workshops focusing on different areas of respiratory disease. Reports will be written on all of these workshops, which will provide guidance to healthcare professionals on how to tackle health inequalities within their field.</p>
<p>Professor Klaus Rabe, President of the ERS, concluded the Summit by saying that “Low socio-economic status is a preventable risk factor in developing respiratory disease and other health conditions and we must act now to improve the current situation.</p>
<p>“Wise political decisions and advocacy can lead to results and it is up to the scientific community to ensure we are providing policymakers with evidence-based solutions for tackling the problem efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>“We must also address the social and environmental determinants of health and this is best done through a whole of government and whole of society approach that includes not only health professionals and health ministers but finance ministers and prime ministers.”</p>";14.06.2012 08:39;o:ce780883918ebe8c7031
MEPs lead urgent plea from health community to prevent health crisis in Europe;meps-lead-urgent-plea-from-health-community-to-prevent-health-crisis-in-europe;"<p>Ahead of the European Summit (June 28-29) Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) joined an alliance of organisations to urge European leaders to act now to prevent a European health crisis.</p>
";"
<p>In Brussels today (June 22), for the first time MEPS, civil society organisations, health organisations, trade unions and industry associations have united in an open letter<b> </b>calling on European leaders to stop cutting essential health and welfare systems, which include respiratory services.</p>
<p>In 2011 the health budgets of eight European nations were cut by more than 1.4 billion euros each, and further cuts are expected. With mortality, morbidity and communicable disease rates rising the alliance urges European leaders to realise that, cutting spending on essential services such as health, particularly in primary care and early intervention, will not be a long-term solution to the European debt crisis.</p>
<p>Anders Olauson, President of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eu-patient.eu/About-EPF/"">European Patients' Forum</a>, identifies that people with chronic conditions, which includes respiratory conditions such as COPD, asthma and cystic fibrosis, will be some of the greatest affected. Austerity measures targeting health services would mean an increase in health inequality both within countries and across Europe, with access to services and standards of care declining. Indiscriminate reductions in health services will lead to late detection of illness and higher long-term costs.</p>
<p>Monika Kosińska, Secretary General of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epha.org/r/163"">European Public Health Alliance (EPHA)</a> states, cuts in health and social care ‘will drive up long term costs, leading to the re-emergence of communicable diseases and put the burden on those people who can afford it least. The lessons learned from the crises of the past is to keep supporting people through the hard times, reform smartly and ensure you have a healthy population that can pick up when the economy improves.’</p>

ERS welcomes Tobacco Products Directive;ers-welcomes-tobacco-products-directive;"<p>The European Respiratory Society (ERS) has today (19 December 2012) welcomed the adoption of the proposed EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). The steps taken by Commissioner Borg are a positive move towards improving the respiratory health of all citizens across Europe<a name=""one""><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
";"
<p>It is estimated that approximately 700 000 EU citizens die prematurely every year because of tobacco consumption. Close to 13 million people in the 27 countries of the EU suffer from one or more of the six main disease categories that are associated with smoking.<a name=""two""><sup>2</sup></a> These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bronchitis and other lower respiratory infections</li>
<li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases</li>
<li>Stroke, heart attacks, arterial obstructions (especially in the legs) and other cardiovascular diseases</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Lung cancers</li>
<li>Other cancers, such as pancreas, esophagus, and stomach</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking about the new Directive, ERS President, Professor Francesco Blasi, said:</p>
<p>""Today is an important date for Europe. The adoption of the EU Tobacco Products Directive by the European Commission is a step of paramount importance in the fight against tobacco and cigarette use in Europe. The ERS welcomes the new Directive and the introduction of pictorial warnings on tobacco products. Evidence shows that measures such as large graphic health warnings are effective in reducing the appeal of tobacco products particularly to women and young people. We know from the Eurobarometer survey that an overwhelming majority of EU citizens support such measures.<sup><a name=""three"">3</a></sup></p>
<p>""We also welcome measures in the Directive to combat illicit trade in tobacco products, with the implementation of a tracking and tracing system. This is an important part of a comprehensive tobacco control policy. However, we need to ensure that these tracking and tracing features are in line with the provisions of the newly-adopted International Protocol on Illicit Trade in tobacco Products, which clearly specifies that they should not be delegated to the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>""We hope that this proposal will be the first step of a new health policy in the EU that will lead to a substantial improvement in the prevention of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases through more stringent legislation on tobacco use. The ERS fully supports the Tobacco Products Directive and asks for its prompt adoption by Members of the European Parliament and Europe's governments, which have all ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and are bound by its obligations.""</p>

";"
<p>The WHO Regional Office for Europe is currently implementing two projects - HRAPIE (Health risks of air pollution in Europe) and REVIHAAP (Evidence on health aspects of air pollution to review EU policies), in order to provide scientific evidence-based advice on health aspects of air pollution, in support of the comprehensive review of European Union's air quality policies scheduled for 2013. As part of project HRAPIE, WHO has developed an electronic survey tool to get input from key stakeholders and expert institutions on the identification of new emerging issues on risks to health from air pollution.</p>
<p>You are invited to complete the survey:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HRAPIE_Survey"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HRAPIE_Survey</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The survey is available on-line until 31 May 2013. It should take no more than 15 minutes to complete the set of questions for each identified risk. More information and some general instructions are provided at the beginning of the survey.</p>
<p><em>More about the WHO and air quality</em><br />To effectively advise the revision of EU air quality policies, REVIHAAP and HRAPIE are addressing a list of 26 key policy-relevant questions posed by the European Commission. These questions cover general aspects of importance for air quality management and also specific topics concerning health aspects of individual air pollutants.</p>
<p>Recommendations stemming from the REVIHAAP and HRAPIE projects are based solely on scientific conclusions on health aspects of air pollution.</p>
<p>A full WHO technical report for project REVIHAAP will be available in the spring 2013. The HRAPIE project will be concluded by September 2013.</p>
<p>WHO activities range from developing methods to quantify health risks to supporting the implementation of international legal instruments and coordinating major international projects, such as REVIHAAP and HRAPIE. In addition to providing evidence-based guidance to policy-makers on how to protect public health, WHO/Europe also helps countries build capacity to assess health risks from air pollution and develop sustainable policies on air quality.</p>
<p>WHO air quality guidelines recommend targets for air quality at which health risks are significantly reduced. They urge the elimination or reduction of the pollutants that are known or are likely to be hazardous to human health and well-being.</p>

The agreement reached has now been signed off by the Council of Ministers today 18th of December. It is aimed at making tobacco products less attractive particularly to children by strengthening the rules on how tobacco products can be manufactured, presented and sold. <a href=""#ref"">[1]</a></p>
";"
<p>After many years of preparations and intense debate at Council and Parliament the European Respiratory Society welcomes the long awaited outcome.</p>
<p>Commenting on the conclusion of negotiations, Chair of the ERS Advocacy Committee and Secretary for European Affairs, Prof. Jean-Paul Sculier stated that:</p>
<p><em>""While the proposed tobacco products legislation could and should have been much more ambitious, we recognise the limits of European policy making and commend those MEPs, Ministers and European Commission officials who have worked hard in the face of massive resistance to protect the health of European citizens</em></p>
<p><em>For me the key of the new directive and the single most effective measure is that there will be an obligation for combined picture and text health warnings to cover<br />65% of the front and the back of packages of tobacco products for smoking.""</em></p>
<p>The European Respiratory Society now urges the Environment and Health Committee and subsequently the entire European Parliament to endorse without delay the agreement reached this week between the institutions.</p>

Less bureaucracy for clinical trials in Europe ;less-bureaucracy-for-clinical-trials-in-europe-;"<p>Europe is a step closer to reaching final agreement on new EU rules for clinical trials that aim to speed up the authorisation procedure and increase the number of clinical trials conducted in Europe.</p>
";"
<p>The 2001 clinical trials directive (CTD) is one of the most sharply-criticised pieces of pharmaceutical legislation in the history of the EU, blamed for increasing pan-European trial costs, adding to the burden of red tape and being the cause for a 25% decrease in applications for clinical trials between 2007 and 2011 in Europe.</p>
<p>The new EU regulation which was proposed by the European Commission in July 2012 has now been further amended by all EU Member states and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>On 20 December 2013, a compromise agreement was reached between Member States and the European Parliament. A further step towards final adoption was made on 23 January 2014, when the European Parliament committee responsible for the legislation voted in favour. It now still only requires formal approval by the European Parliament Plenary, expected in early April, and from Member States before it enters into force and replaces the Clinical Trials Directive for all future new, multinational trials.</p>
<p>The main changes introduced are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new streamlined authorisation procedure based on the submission of a single application dossier to a central electronic portal of the European Medicines Agency.</li>
<li>A single authorisation procedure for all clinical trials, under which a reporting Member State leads the assessment of technical/scientific aspects and each concerned Member State assesses national/local and ethical aspects.</li>
<li>More transparency on the conduct and results of the clinical trial due to a compulsory prior registration on the EU portal</li>
<li>National authorities to grant clinical trial approval at 60 days; however the timeline could be extended by 50 days for advanced therapy medicinal products.</li>
<li>Strengthened rules on the protection of patients and informed consent.</li>
</ul>

European Parliament Workshop on “Electronic Cigarettes” 7 May 2013;european-parliament-workshop-on-electronic-cigarettes-tuesday-7th-of-may-2013;"<p>ERS President Francesco Blasi will take part in a European Parliament Workshop focusing on electronic cigarettes. The Workshop is organized by the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety &nbsp;Committee as part of ongoing discussions on the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive.</p>
";"
<p>Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) are designed to deliver nicotine to the respiratory system. There has been a significant increase in EU distribution &amp; sales of these products since their arrival on the market.</p>
<p>The scientific evidence on the potential benefits and/or risks of these products is inconclusive. In particular, the long terms effects are unknown. More evidence is needed – on the positive or negative effects of these products. Until we know more we should act with caution. We support the Board of Science and the Occupational Medicine Committee of the British Medical Association who state:</p>
<p><br />while ENDS ""have the potential to reduce tobacco-related harm (by helping smokers to cut down and quit), a strong regulatory framework is required for the sale and use of e-cigarettes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure they are safe, quality assured and effective at helping smokers to cut down or quit,</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.3em;"">restrict their marketing, sale and promotion so that it is only targeted at smokers as a way of cutting down and quitting, and does not appeal to non-smokers, in particular children and young people,</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.3em;"">prohibit their use in workplaces and public places to limit second hand exposure to the vapour exhaled by the user, and to ensure their use does not undermine smoking prevention and cessation by reinforcing the normalcy of cigarette use"".</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Member States should recall Article 14 guidelines of the UN – WHO Treaty which state that countries should prioritise cessation (quit) treatments ""strongly based on scientific evidence"". Any regulation of ENDS should be science based. It is important that we have independent EU supported research into these products. This should include medium and long term independent clinical trials, behavioural studies and individual/population post marketing studies.</p>

EU Parliament vote improves measures to decrease air pollution but turns its back on 42,800 lives;eu-parliament-vote-improves-measures-to-decrease-air-pollution-but-turns-its-back-on-42800-lives;"<p>Brussels, 28 October 2015. The European Parliament voted today on the National Emissions Ceilings (NEC) Directive, setting out national limits on a range of air pollutants. The vote, strengthening existing rules, has proven the commitment of MEPs towards improving air quality and protecting public health in the European Union.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the European Parliament voted to support a series of reduction commitments from 2020 to 2030 on a range of health damaging pollutants including methane and ammonia. The Plenary vote has weakened the Environment and Public Health Committee (ENVI) position, notably in the rejection of potentially harmful flexibilities on target dates, the exclusion of enteric methane [1] and mercury thresholds and the adoption of the less ambitious emission levels suggested by the European Commission. Although the vote is stronger than the Commission's proposal, the EU Parliament turned its back on the opportunity to save 42,800 additional lives every year from 2025 onwards.</p>
<p>""Air quality across Europe today is unacceptable and causes suffering for millions as well as over 400,000 premature deaths every year."" stated Nina Renshaw, Secretary General of EPHA ""Today's vote will be a breath of fresh air for all of us, particularly those suffering from respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD. But MEPs missed the opportunity to achieve the air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organisation. Environment Ministers should be more ambitious and close these loopholes on farm emissions and mercury"".</p>
<p>""We are seriously concerned by the lack of long-term vision some MEPs have demonstrated today, in this vote"" added Catherine Hartmann, Secretary General of the European COPD Coalition, ""and in particular for those already suffering from respiratory conditions, such as COPD or asthma whose life are tremendously impaired by poor quality of air. Remember, we do not choose the air we breathe"".</p>
<p>Air pollution is the cause of death of over 400,000 people every year. According to the WHO [2], air pollution is a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and cancer. New studies are emerging indicating a role of ambient air pollution in the development of other chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity[3]. The increasingly poor air quality leads to a significant worsening of the health condition of Europeans, resulting in costly consequences for the European Union - between €330 billion and €940 billion in 2010 alone [4]. The NEC directive constitutes a first, important step towards the reduction of health impacts of poor air quality, but the EU must demonstrate more ambition and health NGOs count on Member States to showcase bigger ambition than that of the MEPs.</p>
<p>The Environment Ministers' Council meeting will reunite in December to deliberate on the NEC Directive.</p>

In this context, <a href=""http://healthupdate.gov.ie/news-room/ireland-set-to-become-second-country-in-the-world-to-introduce-plain-pack-cigarettes-2.html"">Ireland's government has announced </a>this week its intention to introduce plain standardised packaging.</span></p>
";"
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">ERS has consistently called for <a href=""eu-affairs/item/4501-ers-calls-on-eu-to-adopt-plain-packaging-of-tobacco-products-to-discourage-young-smokers.html"">larger health warnings and standard packs </a>to help prevent smoking and we applaud the Irish government for taking this courageous step and encourage other countries to follow Ireland's lead.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Ireland is currently leading <a href=""http://eu2013.ie/"">the Presidency</a><a href=""http://eu2013.ie/""> of the Council of the European Union </a>and it hoped this announcement will have a positive impact on negotiations on the EU's <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/products/revision/"">Tobacco Products Directive </a>which is currently passing through the European Council and Parliament. ERS and in particular the Tobacco Control Committee, led by Prof. Christina Gratziou will continue to work hard to advocate for the largest possible health warnings to be introduced by members of the European Parliament and Europe's governments.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">There is strong evidence that standardised packaging can reduce the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products, can increase the noticeability and effectiveness of health warnings and messages, and that it reduces the use of design techniques that may mislead consumers about the harmfulness of tobacco products.<a title="""" href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;"" color=""#0066cc"">[i]</span></span></a>,<a title="""" href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;"" color=""#0066cc"">[ii]</span></span></a> Furthermore, research shows that children find plain packs (with large graphic health warnings) less appealing and are less likely to be misled by the sophisticated marketing techniques designed to make smoking attractive to youngsters.<a title="""" href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;"" color=""#0066cc"">[iii]</span></span></a> In addition, the tobacco industry denies the power of branding regarding packaging design but at the same time, is using the marketing techniques tempting youth and is tenaciously holding on to package branding.<a title="""" href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;"" color=""#0066cc"">[iv]</span></span></a></span><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">The answer to these marketing techniques targeted at youth is plain; as the Irish Minister for Health has pointed out ""the introduction of standardised packaging will remove the final way for tobacco companies to promote their deadly product.

This measure will allow diesel cars to emit twice the previous European exhaust emissions standard&nbsp;limits, known as Euro 6, from 2017 to 2020 and an excedance of 50% after 2020, increasing the standard to 120 mg/km (while the regulation agreed in 2007 clearly states that the limit should not go beyond 80 mg/km in normal driving).&nbsp;</p>
";"
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 1.3em;"">The RDE (Real Driving Emissions) package was approved by the EU’s Technical Committee on Motor Vehicles last October. The test is a positive move as it aims to&nbsp;</span>assess the real world emissions of air pollution from diesel cars based on data measured on roads and not on values obtained in laboratory settings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, using the new RDE proposal to allow diesel cars to emit over double the Euro 6 limits is a move that is scientifically hard to defend. Prof. Bert Brunekreef, from the ERS Environment and Health Committee said: ""Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emitted by vehicles are major contributors to Nitrogen Dioxides (NO2), which is a toxic gas. &nbsp;Short-term exposure to NO2 can result in lung function changes in sensitive population groups while long-term exposure increases susceptibility to respiratory infections. It has also been suggested that pollution mixtures represented by NO2 may be responsible for some 72,000 premature deaths per year in the EU28"".&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">European Lung Foundation Chair, Dan Smyth, said: ""We are disappointed by the outcome of today's vote as it weakens existing limits on diesel cars. Air pollution is responsible for over 400,000 premature deaths in the European Union each year, causing health-related economic costs estimated between €330 and €940 billion annually. We believe that everyone has the right to breathe clean air and we will continue to lobby for better air quality during the Commission's annual reviews.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the recent diesel gate scandal, the European institutions missed the opportunity to turn things around and offer cleaner air to European citizens. The Commission has committed to an annual review of the proposals, in which they will work towards <span style=""font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px; text-align: justify;"">reducing the extent to which diesel cars can pollute above legal limits.&nbsp;</span>ERS will focus its advocacy now on these annual reviews to ensure that the move towards better air quality will be achieved.&nbsp;</p>

November 13th in the European Parliament:Tuberculosis in Europe – Eliminating the Modern Threat ;november-13th-in-the-european-parliamenttuberculosis-in-europe-eliminating-the-modern-threat-;"<p>There is a growing threat of a re‐emergence in Europe of a fatal form of tuberculosis – multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB) and extensively drug‐resistant tuberculosis (XDR‐TB). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 400,000 tuberculosis cases occur in Europe, a large proportion of them among migrants.</p>
";"
<p>On November 13th ERS will organise a lunch event in the European Parliament hosted by Maria da Graça Carvalho (EPP).</p>
<p>The purpose of the event is</p>
<ul>
<li>to deliver the message that total TB control and elimination is possible, taking into account several important areas including MDR/XDR TB.</li>
<li>to raise awareness of the need to have a coordinated European public health mechanism to guarantee TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care across borders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone can get TB. Everyone needs to act to eliminate it!</p>

Political commitment in the EU is key to wider TB recognition and subsequent action. I will urge the European Parliament to call on the European Commission and the Member States to establish clear targets, clear plans and clear pledges, with committed funding”.</span></p>
<p><span>An audience of medical experts, MEPs and representatives of different stakeholders heard the keynote from ERS Past-President, Prof Francesco Blasi, who presented the ERS roadmap towards TB elimination. He outlined, for example, the<a href=""http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/40/4/806.extract"" target=""_blank""> European Forum for TB Innovation</a> and the <a href=""https://www.tbconsilium.org/"" target=""_blank"">ERS/WHO TB Consilium</a>. This was followed by an update from Dr Line Matthiessen (Head of the Infectious Diseases Unit at DG Research), who discussed the Global TB Vaccine Partnership (GTBVP). GTBVP is currently being established to accelerate TB vaccine development, with the main goal of effective and globally accessible TB vaccines.</span></p>
<p><span>After these interventions, presentations and a lively discussion on tackling the TB problem and finding the solutions ensued. ERS Secretary-General, Prof Giovanni Battista Migliori, emphasised EU commitment and investment in research and public health, and Dr Piotr Kramarz (Deputy Chief Scientist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) stated that countries should take into account the national TB epidemiological situation. </span></p>
<p><span>Dr Roberto Bertollini (Chief Scientist and WHO Representative to the European Union) underlined the equipping of civil society organisations and communities with efficient tools and resources. Dr Mario Raviglione (Director of the Global TB Programme at the World Health Organization) said that the MDR-TB challenge is not yet properly addressed and that the European Union is best placed to take leadership in the elimination of TB as a public health problem.</span></p>

European Antibiotic Awareness Day 2014;european-antibiotic-awareness-day-2014;"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This week marked the annual European Antibiotic Awareness Day (18 November), an initiative which aims to raise awareness of the threat posed by antibiotic resistance.</p>
";"
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The event is coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) - a European Union agency which is tasked with identifying, evaluating and communicating about the threat posed by infectious diseases, thereby increasing Europe's ability to tackle them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the ECDC, the latest data confirms that the number of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections is increasing throughout Europe. Hence, this year's event focused on self-medication with antibiotics, highlighting that antibiotic resistance is a threat to global public health, and thus ""everyone is responsible, everywhere"" for its sensible use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As part of this initiative, the ECDC organised an EU-level stakeholder event, on the 17 November in Stockholm. This was an opportunity for the invited organisations to discuss how they are dealing with the challenges posed by bacterial antibiotic resistance. ERS is closely involved in this topic, through the activities of the Respiratory Infections Assembly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The stakeholder event also served to officially launch new, ECDC-developed materials on self-medication with antibiotics, such as the European Antibiotic Awareness Day Toolkit. These documents give guidance on how national public health authorities, as well as health professionals, can engage with citizens to promote the adequate use of antibiotics.</p>

Breathe clean air on World COPD Day ;breathe-clean-air-on-world-copd-day-;"<p>19 November is World COPD Day. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung condition that causes inflammation in the lungs, damages lung tissue and a narrows of the airways, making breathing difficult. 2014 is the 13th annual World COPD Day, an event held each November to raise awareness of COPD worldwide and to encourage people to check their lung health.</p>
";"
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""images/stories/EU-affairs/COPDAD.JPG"" width=""458"" height=""663"" alt=""COPDAD"" /></p>
<p>In Europe, about 40-50% of lifelong smokers will develop COPD. The latest statistics presented in the <a href=""http://www.erswhitebook.org/"" target=""_blank"">European Lung White Book</a> have shown us that 300,000 deaths occur in Europe from COPD each year. In addition to tobacco smoke, air quality is another important risk factor, which can greatly exacerbate symptoms in 100% of suffers.</p>
<p>This is why ERS and ELF made breathe clean air the focus of their first annual<a href=""http://www.europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-research/projects/healthy-lungs-for-life/home/"" target=""_blank""> Health Lungs for Life Campaign</a>. The campaign, which was launched in September in Munich, seeks to increase understanding of the impact of poor air quality on lung health and raise awareness of the actions that everyone can take to protect their own lungs from indoor and outdoor air pollution. The campaign targets the public, health professionals, but also policy makers.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/clean_air_policy.htm"" target=""_blank"">EU Air Policy Package</a>&nbsp;is one way in which cleaner air can be achieved. In particular, through the revision of the National Emissions Ceiling Directive (NECD), which is a key element of the policy package. The NECD limits the level of certain pollutants which can be emitted in the EU. The aim of the directive is to gradually improve, through a reduction of pollutants, the protection both of human health and the environment throughout the EU.</p>
<p>Worryingly, the Directive, which was proposed by the previous Commission, is one of a series of legislative proposals, which may be dropped by the Juncker Commission, in the name of better regulation.</p>
<p>ERS and ELF urge the Juncker Commission to keep this file on the agenda. Cleaner air can only serve to benefit Europe's health, but also its economy.</p>

In particular, the ERS hopes the new legislation will help reduce the number of children who start smoking.</p>
";"
<p>Speaking after the vote, ERS Secretary for European Affairs, Professor Jean-Paul Sculier, said:</p>
<p>""It is over 10 years since the first Tobacco Products Directive; we have supported efforts over many years for a revision. We would have liked a stronger text in line with the scientific evidence. Regrettably, politics is the art of the possible and not an exact science.""</p>
<p>""Nonetheless, I am pleased that the legislation will finally be updated. The most important elements are that more prominent health warnings will be on tobacco products, attractive lipstick style packages will not be allowed, and flavours such as menthol will be prohibited.

Air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk;air-pollution-is-now-the-worlds-largest-single-environmental-health-risk;"<p>In new estimates released on 25 March, WHO reports that in 2012 around 7 million people died - one in eight of total global deaths – as a result of air pollution exposure. This finding more than doubles previous estimates.</p>
";"
<p>In particular, the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. This is in addition to air pollution's role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
<p>The new estimates are not only based on more knowledge about the diseases caused by air pollution, but also upon better assessment of human exposure to air pollutants through the use of improved measurements and technology. This has enabled scientists to make a more detailed analysis of health risks from a wider demographic spread that now includes rural as well as urban areas.</p>

She was invited to speak on multidisciplinary approaches for the prevention, treatment and control of chronic respiratory diseases. Prof Bel focused her presentation on the changing face of the respiratory patient.</p>
";"
<p>In Europe, 9 people out of 10 die of a chronic disease. They include heart disease, stroke, cancers, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension, allergies, kidney and liver diseases. Chronic diseases are also very costly, estimated to be responsible for up to 80 % of all healthcare costs. The good news is that they are also among the most preventable and can be effectively controlled.</p>
<p>This first EU Summit brought together key policymakers, stakeholders and interest groups to explore ways to address chronic diseases effectively in the EU and to develop concrete recommendations along on ways to move forward.</p>
<p>Prof Bel called upon the crucial and leading role that the EU can and should take in the field of prevention and the need for the EU to further invest in strengthened measures for major risk factors that underlie many chronic respiratory diseases. As an example, the EU has a vital role to improve air quality standards (outdoor and indoor); follow up on countries' implementation on smoke-free environments; improve occupational health and safety standards, and reduce health inequalities.</p>
<p>Prof Bel agreed on the necessity of adopting a more multidisciplinary approach to treatment – however she stressed that greater understanding and more education and training across the lines of healthcare including primary care will be needed, as chronic respiratory diseases often affect several organs creating comorbid conditions, and are complex to treat.</p>
<p>ERS is also a member of the European Chronic Disease Alliance (ECDA) who also was invited to the Summit, and the current Chairman, Prof Norbert Lameire spoke on the topic ""Stakeholder involvement as asset in response to chronic diseases"".</p>

New and clearer rules for EU clinical trials approved ;new-and-clearer-rules-for-eu-clinical-trials-approved-;"<p>The informally agreed law on clinical trials was formally approved by an overwhelming majority of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on 2nd April and by the Council on 14th April.</p>
";"
<p>The approved draft regulation aims at restoring the EU's competitiveness in clinical research and the development of new treatments and medicines by reducing bureaucracy enabling clinical trials to be larger, more viable and more reliable.</p>
<p>The new regulation will make it easier to conduct multinational clinical trials i.e. in several EU countries, which are particularly important for rare diseases where there are not enough patients in one country alone.</p>
<p>Member States agreed to the demands of the MEPs to improve transparency, by requiring that detailed summaries be published in a publicly-accessible EU database, including full clinical study reports to be published once a decision on marketing authorisation has been taken or the marketing authorisation application has been withdrawn.</p>
<p>The Regulation ensures a streamlined authorisation procedure with one single application sufficient for conducting clinical trials in several member states. Other measures to cut red tape are simplified reporting procedures so that researchers no longer have to submit largely identical information on the clinical trial separately to various bodies and Member States.</p>
<p>The regulation also sets timelines, so that when a clinical trial sponsor has submitted an application dossier to a member state, the applicable timeline for authorisation of clinical trials at 60 days. If no decision is taken within this period the authorisation is deemed to be given ('tacit approval'). Member States will however continue to make their independent assessment of notably ethical issues.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-research/projects/smokehaz/home"" target=""_blank"">SmokeHaz</a> aims to provide scientific information on the negative consequences of active and passive smoking for public health. The recommendations document provides a concise overview of the evidence showing the links between smoking and lung conditions. <a href=""http://www.europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-research/projects/smokehaz/recommendations"" target=""_blank"">It also provides 8 key recommendations for how to reduce the burden of tobacco-related lung conditions.</a></p>
<p>The new website was launched during an event in Athens, Greece, which coincided with the country's EU Presidency. Guests at the event included Greek Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis, ERS President Peter Barnes, Chair of the ERS Tobacco Control Committee Christina Gratziou and ELF Chair Monica Fletcher.</p>
<p>The launch gained impressive media coverage across Greece, including articles in electronic and print media as well as radio and TV coverage.<br />Greek Health Minister Mr. Adonis Georgiadis stated: ""The Greek government is at war with smoking. The last years, we have taken all necessary institutional measures to persuade Greek citizens to refrain from smoking. Smoking kills, both those smoking and those around them and that is something we can't stand watching or no longer stay inert.""</p>
<p>Prof. Peter Barnes, President of the European Respiratory Society, said: ""It is a fact that 1 in 8 deaths in the European Union originates from respiratory diseases. In fact over 50% of deaths are caused by lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are directly related to smoking. To better understand the magnitude of the problem it is worth mentioning that each year there are over 6 million hospital admissions due to respiratory disease with a total cost of over 380 billion euros.""</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Tobacco Control Committee of ERS, Prof Christina Gratziou, said: ""Health authorities should harmonize and implement health policy in accordance with the instructions of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) of the World Health Organization in all the states of Europe. We hope that SmokeHaz will provide all stakeholders with an important source of documented scientific information. Additionally, the website lists recommendations that will help towards the implementation of a broader policy for the control and restriction of the smoking habit.""</p>

Sulphur dioxide reductions would lead to greater lung health benefits;sulphur-dioxide-reductions-would-lead-to-greater-lung-health-benefits;"<p>EU air pollution legislation to reduce sulphur dioxide (SO2) has effectively reduced rates of premature deaths, new research suggests. Moreover, additional reductions would lead to even further public health benefits, the researchers say.</p>
";"
<p>Since the 1990s, the EU has steadily strengthened its air quality legislation so as to reduce the levels of air pollutants, such as the sulphur dioxide (SO2). These EU policies successfully brought about an 80% reduction in the emissions of this chemical, which had been linked to both respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.</p>
<p>Previous research on the impact of sulphur dioxide on wellbeing, had suggested the existence of a direct relation between SO2 levels and the number of deaths associated with this type of air pollution.</p>
<p>However, today's SO2 concentrations are well below those which previous research and conclusions were based on. Hence, there was a need to find out whether the link between SO2 and illness still holds true at low levels.</p>
<p>A recently published study, supported by the EU Aphekom project, looked at the changes in SO2 concentrations and the daily number of deceased due to illness since the 1990s. This analysis focused on 20 European cities and on the periods before and after the introduction of EU air quality legislation.</p>
<p>The results showed that an increase of 1 microgram of SO2 per cubic metre had the same impact on mortality in the late 2000s (post-legislation) as in early 1990 (pre-legislation). Thus, the results of this study, suggest that even at low levels the correlation between SO2 concentration and the impact on health holds true.</p>
<p>The above conclusions are important for two reasons. First, they suggest that further reduction on the SO2 levels will most likely bring further public health benefits. Second, it shows the unparalleled positive impact that the EU, through its legislation, can have on the health and wellbeing of citizens.</p>

European Commission must keep clean air on EU legislative agenda ;european-commission-must-keep-clean-air-on-eu-legislative-agenda-;"<p>Clean air is essential to improve our health and our green economy and it must stay on the legislative agenda – this is the message from ERS and ELF to the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>

<p>Worryingly, the Directive, which was proposed by the previous Commission, is one of a series of legislative proposals, which may be dropped by the Juncker Commission, in the name of better regulation.</p>
<p>The air quality package and NEC Directive will not only save lives and improve health; it will be a positive driver for innovation in industry, for climate change actions and for energy policy targets. It will contribute to Europe's role as a leader in green growth, innovation and environmental protection at the international level.</p>

";"
<p>At a meeting on 9 March, EU ministers of Health and Employment declared the importance of using new technologies in healthcare to ensure safe, universal, and cost-effective health services. In its conclusions of the meeting, the Council adopted an <a href=""http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%206147%202015%20INIT"">official statement</a> which summarises the vital role that information and communication technology can play. The statement demonstrated many benefits of incorporating new technologies into healthcare, from improving patients' self-management of diseases, to allowing the development of more effective and more personalised care.</p>

The Clean Air Package must stay;thecleanairpackagemuststay;"<p>ERS and ELF repeated their support today (12 December) for the EU Clean Air Package, which appears to be under an increasing threat of being sidelined.</p>
";"
<p>In response to the increasing signs that the Juncker Commission is going to withdraw the Clean Air Package from its 2015 Work Programme, the European Respiratory Society and European Lung Foundation (ELF), who are advocating for cleaner air as part of the Healthy Lungs for Life campaign, noted that:</p>
<p>""If the Juncker Commission is looking for big problems to solve that will have a big impact on the health and well-being of the European population, air pollution is one of the most important as it affects 100% of us. By dropping the Clean Air Package and the National Emission Ceilings directive, Mr Timmermans is missing a prime opportunity – the NEC Directive would reduce exposure to pollutants in the air which currently cause 400,000 premature deaths in Europe each year. It would also testify to EU's leadership on green growth and environmental protection on the international stage, would act as a catalyst for energy policy targets and would encourage industry to innovate on their climate change action. Instead, the health concerns of Europeans have been dropped and our health will suffer"".</p>

ERS supports call for amended data protection legislation;ers-supports-call-for-amended-data-protection-legislation;"<p>The European Parliament and Council are currently discussing new data protection legislation, which if approved, could seriously hamper scientific progress in Europe.</p>
";"
<p>The legislation covers the use of personal data across a wide range of sectors. In healthcare, the legislation will affect how patient data are used in research.</p>
<p>The latest version, presented by the European Parliament in March 2014, could make the research process very difficult, if not impossible. It prohibits the use of anonymous (pseudonymised) personal data in scientific research without specific consent and also the use of identifiable data without consent.</p>
<p>The original version of the legislation made an exemption to researchers from asking for specific consent for personal data use in research. This was largely welcomed by the scientific community, who are now very concerned about the impact of the new legislation.</p>
<p>As a direct reaction to the threat posed by this draft legislation, an alliance composed of European academic, patient and research organisations was created. The European Data in Health Research Alliance, launched a digital campaign to save the future of health research in the EU, by ensuring that a new data protection legislation takes into account the particular requirements of health research.</p>
<p>ERS have joined the initiative as it considers that the future of respiratory medicine, and the well-being of present and future patients, is at risk. ERS recognises that protection of data is of the utmost importance. However, such protection should not hinder scientific progress, which is of benefit to all.</p>

It's Time To Control Asthma;qits-time-to-control-asthmaq;"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today, the 5th of May 2015, is being celebrated World Asthma day all over the world. It is organised by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and aims at raising awareness through various events and promotional activities. In Europe, about 30 million children and adults under 45 years of age have asthma. Although the disease can usually be well controlled, there are currently no proven methods of prevention or cure. In addition, 5% of asthma patients remain unresponsive to current treatment options.</p>
";"
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ERS is actively committed to reduce the burden of asthma in Europe. In 2014, international guidelines on definition, evaluation and treatment of severe asthma were published by ERS and the American Thoracic society (ATS). Moreover, ERS, through the European Lung Foundation (ELF), has taken part in several European projects related to asthma. <a href=""http://www.europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-research/projects/u-biopred/home"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"" color=""#0066cc"">U-BIOPRED</span></span></a> for example, is a research project which aims to advance the understanding of severe asthma and identify severe asthma phenotypes from 'omics and clinical data. This will ultimately lead to better and more personalised diagnosis and treatment. Using a similar approach, <a href=""http://www.europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-research/projects/airprom/home"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0066cc;"" color=""#0066cc"">AIRPROM</span></span></a>&nbsp;also aims at developing more personalised treatment of airway diseases by producing new digital models of the lungs. This is based on investigations including genetic information, lung function test and CT and MRI scans. ERS also proposes several ""CME online learning module"" related to asthma. The latest looks at the strategies to improve poor asthma control by focusing on the patients' use of inhaler technique.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Among all the future development and research needs, ERS' White book highlighted the necessity for new therapeutic approaches regarding treatment-resistant asthma. This could be achieved in five years according to a recent study published in Science Transnational Medicine. Researchers from Cardiff University and the King's College of London discovered that protein molecules called Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) cause asthma. A specific class of drugs is already known to have an interesting effect on CaSR, and researchers believe that it may hold potential for a new Asthma therapy. The discovery could be life-changing for patients who suffer from poor adherence to the current treatment options.</p>

ERS inputs into the debate on real world evidence ;ers-inputs-into-the-debate-on-real-world-evidence-;"<p>ERS has submitted an official response to The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations’ (EFPIA’s) latest consultation on healthcare: ‘Big data for better outcomes’. EFPIA have launched the consultation, under Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2), to address how we can achieve a coordinated, consistent and efficient approach to managing large datasets and real world evidence.</p>
";"
<p>EFPIA believes this could be achieved if there was overall agreement on standardised outcomes that matter to patients, appropriate data sources and methods to collect, analyse, report and use and interpret data – and this is exactly the scope of this proposed IMI programme as it would leverage the expertise from all concerned stakeholders – both private and public. The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA)'s latest consultation on big data and better outcomes in healthcare.</p>
<p>ERS submitted a response to EFPIA's consultation encouraging this initiative whilst underlining that respiratory diseases need to be explicitly addressed in any such Big Data initiative. Given the enormous burden of respiratory diseases, coupled with the scant number of new respiratory therapies and high failure rates, ERS emphasised the need for such data to be clinically useful, easy to use and easily accessible.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial agents - such as antibiotics - have dramatically reduced the number of deaths from infectious diseases since their introduction 70 years ago. However, through overuse and misuse, many micro-organisms have become resistant to them. It is estimated that each year this growing antimicrobial resistance causes some 25,000 deaths and over €1.5 billion in healthcare expenses and productivity losses in Europe alone.</p>
<p>European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation Carlos Moedas said: ""Growing resistance to antibiotics is one of the biggest challenges to public health today, we need to bring new classes of antibiotics to market and we need to take preventative measures to stop antibiotics being over-prescribed and over-used"".</p>

ERS supports the fight against rare respiratory diseases;ers-supports-the-fight-against-rare-respiratory-diseases;"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rare Disease Day will be marked across Europe this weekend (28 February), with the aim of improving the quality of life for people living with rare conditions.</p>
";"
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ERS is committed to tackling rare respiratory conditions and finding new treatments for patients. The ERS-endorsed Sixth International Meeting on Pulmonary Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs will be held in Milan on Rare Disease Day demonstrating the latest advances in medical research in that field.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With a conservative estimate that primary or secondary lung involvement occurs in 5% of rare diseases (&gt;6000 types), approximatively 1-2 million people in the European Union are likely to be affected by rare respiratory diseases. Cumulatively, rare respiratory diseases represent a significant burden of disease, with many of these being severe conditions that result in premature death or major morbidity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rare Diseases Day, coordinated by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS), will see a wide range of activities and many other actions designed to reduce the impact of rare diseases on the lives of patients and family.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the European level, ERS believes that the European Union has a key role to play to overcome differences in the national health systems that can discriminate patients with rare conditions and limit their access to treatment. It is important to create dedicated European referral centres and networks that can manage patients and consequently, maximise the skills in the management of particularly rare diseases.</p>

Ireland becomes first country in Europe to adopt plain packaging ;ireland-becomes-first-country-in-europe-to-adopt-plain-packaging-;"<p>Ireland has taken a landmark move and passed new legislation banning branded cigarette packets. The new law will also make it illegal to sell cigarettes in lipstick-style containers designed to attract female smokers.</p>
";"
<p>Ireland becomes only the second country in the world to pass such legislation and the Bill commits to the introduction of plain packaging for all tobacco manufactured from 20 May, 2016.</p>
<p>Big tobacco companies have warned that they will take the Irish government to court to challenge the bill, although advocacy groups believe this will be defeated following the Australian example. Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging in 2012. The government here was also taken to court by Big Tobacco but the attempt was defeated by the public health argument, since tobacco is known to have serious damaging health effects.</p>
<p>Chair of the ERS Tobacco Control Committee, Carlos Jimenez Ruiz, commented: ""ERS has consistently called for larger health warnings and standard packs to help prevent smoking and we applaud the Irish government for taking this courageous step. We believe this will trigger changes across the EU, as we saw after Ireland introduced smoke free public areas. This legislation serves the interests of public health and we are certain it will help to dissuade children from taking up tobacco and persuade smokers to quit. We now encourage other countries across the EU to follow Ireland's lead.""</p>
